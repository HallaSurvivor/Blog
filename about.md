Hello! I'm Christina (Chris, Tina, and Christina are all fine!), 
a [transfemme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman)
math PhD candidate at UC Riverside. I got my
undergraduate degree (in Discrete Math & Logic) from Carnegie Mellon, where I
also studied music and computer science.
My mathematical interests lie in the intersection of algebra, geometry,
and logic -- an intersection which is often made clearer with the language
of category theory.
Following in the great mathematical tradition, I'll
write my email as: cgros007 AT ucr DOT edu.

Besides math, my first love is the flute, which I've been 
playing for over 20 years now -- though recently I've been spending a lot
of time writing music and playing piano.
I am a huge proponent of the
[Dalcroze School](https://dalcrozeusa.org/about-dalcroze/what-is-dalcroze/)
of music pedagogy, which emphasizes improvisation and the playfulness of 
learning. My history with Dalcroze has had an obvious impact on my mathematical 
pedagogy as well.

I think examples are extremely important when learning anything, and
computation is an invaluable resource when doing research. I started 
a blog to share examples that I've found helpful in learning new 
subjects, and to show how computers can be used "in the wild" to help 
solve problems.
