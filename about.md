Hello! I'm Chris, a [transfemme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman)
math PhD candidate at UC Riverside. I got my
undergraduate degree (in Discrete Math & Logic) from Carnegie Mellon, where I
also studied music and computer science.
My mathematical interests lie in the intersection of algebra, geometry,
and logic -- an intersection which is often made clearer with the language
of category theory.
Following in the great mathematical tradition, I
will write my email as: cgros007 AT ucr DOT edu.

It's not healthy to spend all of your time on math, and I keep myself
busy with other passions as well.
I've been playing flute for over 20 years now, and have been composing for
over 10. I am a huge proponent of the
[Dalcroze School](https://dalcrozeusa.org/about-dalcroze/what-is-dalcroze/)
of music pedagogy, and I like to bring Dalcrozian ideas into my
mathematics teaching. I also watch too much youtube.

I think examples are extremely important when learning anything, and
computation is an invaluable resource when doing research. Unfortunately,
I am often unable to find explicit examples of objects and theorems in 
higher mathematics. Moreover, there aren't many resources for 
seeing how mathematicians "in the wild" use computers to help understand the 
problems they're solving. I started a blog to try and combat both of these 
issues. Whenever I struggle to find (useful) concrete examples 
of a theorem I'm learning, I'll make a post so that future students will have an 
easier time finding some. I'll also post about my research, often with examples 
of [sage](https://sagemath.org) code that I've used to play with the problem at hand.

This website was designed by the incredible [Remy Davison](https://remydavison.com).
Many thanks for both his friendship and his artistic skill.

I have had some mathematicians tell me that I need to "get over" a
"reliance" on concrete examples. Out of spite, or perhaps to clarify my views
on the topic, here is a quote that I deeply identify with:

> "If you are, like me, someone who prefers large vistas and powerful theories
> (I was influenced but not converted by Grothendieck), then it is essential to
> be able to test general results by applying them to simple examples....
> These are examples where one can do concrete calculations, sometimes with
> elaborate formulas, that help to make the general theory understandable.
> They keep your feet on the ground.... [M]ost of all a good example is a thing
> of beauty. It shines and convinces. It gives insight and understanding.
> It provides the bedrock of belief." -- Sir Michael Atiyah.
