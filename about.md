Hello! I'm Chris, a [nonbinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender) 
math PhD student at UC Riverside. I got my 
undergraduate degree (in Discrete Math & Logic) from Carnegie Mellon, where I 
also studied music and computer science. If you want to reach me, always feel 
free to email. Following in the great mathematical tradition, I
will write my email as: cgros007 AT ucr DOT edu.

I've been playing flute for almost 20 years now, and have been composing for
almost 10. Also, I took a year off before starting grad school to be a 
professional magician. My mathematical interests lie in the intersection of algebra,
geometry, and logic. I think my [blog posts](/blog) do a good job showcasing 
what I mean by this.

I think examples are extremely important when learning anything, and
computation is an invaluable resource when doing research. Unfortunately,
I feel like I often find myself unable to find concrete examples of many
objects or theorems in mathematics. Moreover, there aren't many resources for
seeing how mathematicians "in the wild" use computers to help understand 
the problems they're solving. I started my blog to try and combat both of those.
Whenever I struggle to find concrete examples of a theorem I'm learning,
I will post the ones I come up with myself on this blog.

I have had many mathematicians tell me that I need to "get over" a 
"reliance" on concrete examples. Out of spite, or perhaps to clarify my views
on the topic, here is a quote that I feel embodies my views:

<div class="boxed" markdown="1">
"If you are, like me, someone who prefers large vistas and powerful theories 
(I was influenced but not converted by Grothendieck), then it is essential to 
be able to test general results by applying them to simple examples.... 
These are examples where one can do concrete calculations, sometimes with 
elaborate formulas, that help to make the general theory understandable. 
They keep your feet on the ground.... [M]ost of all a good example is a thing
of beauty. It shines and convinces. It gives insight and understanding.
It provides the bedrock of belief." -- Sir Michael Atiyah.
</div>

Perhaps less spitefully, here are some other quotes that I find impactful:

- "You should feel free to skip lightly over, or 'read for culture', explanatory
material which seems difficult, or which uses idea of which you have not yet 
heard... You should think of them as something to return to when more of the 
pieces in the vast puzzle of mathematics have fallen into place for you." --
David Eisenbud.

- "The most useful piece of advice I would give to a mathematics student is 
always to suspect an impressive sounding Theorem if it does not have a 
special case which is both simple and non-trivial." -- Sir Michael Atiyah
