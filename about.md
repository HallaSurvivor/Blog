Hello! I'm Chris, a [nonbinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender)
math PhD student at UC Riverside. I got my
undergraduate degree (in Discrete Math & Logic) from Carnegie Mellon, where I
also studied music and computer science.
My mathematical interests lie in the intersection of algebra, geometry,
and logic -- an intersection which is often made clearer with the language
of category theory.
Following in the great mathematical tradition, I
will write my email as: cgros007 AT ucr DOT edu.

It's not healthy to spend all of your time on math, and I keep myself
busy with other passions as well.
I've been playing flute for almost 20 years now, and have been composing for
almost 10. I am a huge proponent of the
[Dalcroze School](https://dalcrozeusa.org/about-dalcroze/what-is-dalcroze/)
of music pedagogy, and I like to bring Dalcrozian ideas into my
mathematics teaching. I also watch too much youtube.

I think examples are extremely important when learning anything, and
computation is an invaluable resource when doing research. Unfortunately,
I am often unable to find explicit examples of objects and theorems in 
higher mathematics. Moreover, there aren't many resources for 
seeing how mathematicians "in the wild" use computers to help understand the 
problems they're solving. I started a blog to try and combat both of these 
issues. Whenever I struggle to find (useful) concrete examples 
of a theorem I'm learning, I'll make a post so that future students will have an 
easier time finding some. I'll also post about my research, often with examples 
of [sage](https://sagemath.org) code that I've used to play with the problem at hand.

I have had some mathematicians tell me that I need to "get over" a
"reliance" on concrete examples. Out of spite, or perhaps to clarify my views
on the topic, here is a quote that I deeply identify with:

<div class="boxed" markdown="1">
"If you are, like me, someone who prefers large vistas and powerful theories
(I was influenced but not converted by Grothendieck), then it is essential to
be able to test general results by applying them to simple examples....
These are examples where one can do concrete calculations, sometimes with
elaborate formulas, that help to make the general theory understandable.
They keep your feet on the ground.... [M]ost of all a good example is a thing
of beauty. It shines and convinces. It gives insight and understanding.
It provides the bedrock of belief." -- Sir Michael Atiyah.
</div>

Perhaps less spitefully, here are some other quotes that I find impactful:

- "Discipline is the difference between what you want now and what you
want more" -- Darryl Bott

- "You should feel free to skip lightly over, or 'read for culture', explanatory
material which seems difficult, or which uses idea of which you have not yet
heard... You should think of them as something to return to when more of the
pieces in the vast puzzle of mathematics have fallen into place for you." --
David Eisenbud.

- Pablo Casals, at the age of 95, was asked why he still practiced six hours
every day. He answered "Because I think I'm making progress."

- "The most useful piece of advice I would give to a mathematics student is
always to suspect an impressive sounding Theorem if it does not have a
special case which is both simple and non-trivial." -- Sir Michael Atiyah

- "Never be happy with where you are, but always be happy with 
where you came from" -- Dan D'Addio

- I see mathematics, the part of human knowledge that I call mathematics, 
as one thing—one great, glorious thing. Whether it is differential topology, 
or functional analysis, or homological algebra, it is all one thing. ... 
They are intimately interconnected, they are all facets of the same thing. 
That interconnection, that architecture, is secure truth and is beauty. 
That's what mathematics is to me.” -- Paul Halmos

- "just a quick reminder that a society exists to serve the people within it.
there's no such thing as a person being "useless" to a society, only a society
that is useless to a person" -- Twitter User @HTHRFLWRS

- “Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. 
All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. 
But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just 
not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. 
But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. 
And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get 
past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative 
work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special 
thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just 
starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and 
the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a 
deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going 
through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be 
as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than 
anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. 
You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”  -- Ira Glass

- "Learning mathematics is like climbing a cliff that's sheer vertical
in front of you and horizontal behind you." -- David Epstin, via Twitter
