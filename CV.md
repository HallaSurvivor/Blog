## Outreach and Service

 - [Vernon A Kramer Memorial Service Award][8] Recipient (2025)
     - Christina Grossack stands out for helping shape the culture of the 
        department through her: mentorship; advocacy; and vibrant, welcoming 
        personality. She is appreciated both within and outside the department 
        for her mentoring in the Building Bridges to the Professoriate 
        program, her advocacy as a founding member of UCRâ€™s chapter of Spectra, 
        her advice as a panelist on the Choosing a PhD Advisor Panel, her 
        volunteering at Preview Day, and for sharing her passion for 
        mathematics through discussions with peers and via her blog.

 - DOI and Metadata Maintainer at [Theory and Applications of Categories][10] (2024--ongoing)

 - [BB2P Mentor][7] (2024)

 - Artistic Expression of Original Research participant (2024)
     - The Artistic Expression of Original Research art exhibition 
     exemplifies the incredible work produced from blending the humanities 
     and sciences. Graduate students translate science into art to communicate 
     science in a new way and how it might be meaningful to our communities. 
     Part of the national Being Human Festival, supported by the National 
     Humanities Center, Center for Ideas and Society, and the Gluck Fellows 
     Program of the Arts at UCR

 - Vice President of UCR [AMS Chapter][6] (2023)

 - [HoTTEST Summer School][1] (TA and Unofficial Organizer, 2022)
     - Stated goal is 
     "to make homotopy type theory accessible to, and inclusive of, 
     everyone who is interested, regardless of cultural background, age, 
     ability, formal education, ethnicity, gender identity, or expression."

 - [SUBGroups][4] (Group Leader and Mentor, 2022)

 - [SciComm@UCR][2] (2021)
     - "A student organization working to communicate science in creative ways"

 - Math/Music Event (Lead Organizer and Composer, 2020, cancelled due to covid)
    - An interdisciplinary event where composers with a math/computer science
      background would perform work relating to mathematics, and give a short
      talk on the mathematics that went into their piece.
