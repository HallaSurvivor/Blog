## Outreach

 - [HoTTEST Summer School][1] (TA and Unofficial Organizer, 2022)
     - Stated goal is 
     "to make homotopy type theory accessible to, and inclusive of, 
     everyone who is interested, regardless of cultural background, age, 
     ability, formal education, ethnicity, gender identity, or expression."

 - [SciComm@UCR][2] (2021-present)
     - "A student organization working to communicate science in creative ways"

 - Math/Music Event (Lead Organizer and Composer, 2020, cancelled due to covid)
    - An interdisciplinary event where composers with a math/computer science
      background would perform work relating to mathematics, and give a short
      talk on the mathematics that went into their piece.

 - Academic Review Board and University Disciplinary Committee (Board Member, 2017-2019)

 - Frequently in the top 0.1% of users on [math.stackexchange][3]
