This is a (very!) rough draft of my teaching statement 

---

With almost ten years of university level teaching behind me, I've developed 
a deep sense of what works to help students with _assignments and with 
learning the course material_ [6].
My focus is always on being _incredibly kind, approachable, and friendly_ [17], 
which makes students feel _comfortable asking questions_ [12] so that 
_anyone can mention their problems_ [20]. I believe students learn better 
when they engage with the material and participate in class, and I do 
everything I can to _provide a safe and comfortable learning environment that 
allows students to ask questions and take part in discussion_ [19] 
and to _make everyone feel involved_ [8].
I also believe that students learn better when they care about the material, so I 
like to provide _helpful analogies_ and _connect material to the real world_ [13]
while showing the _"bigger picture" of each topic_ [7] to help students
understand _where things come from and why they should care_ [9].
More than anything, I try to make math _fun and interesting_ [3].

It helps that I personally find basically every branch of math 
"fun and interesting", and my _enthusiasm for the math_ [19] shines 
through in everything I teach. Direct quotes from student evaluations
(shown in _italics_ throughout, with small modifications for grammar) are 
taken from staple classes such as precalculus through multivariable calculus and 
linear algebra, as well as upper division classes like number theory, geometry, 
discrete math, and complex analysis. A complete list of the direct quotes 
are included at the end of this document. Students say it's 
_pretty amazing that I can help them with any question 
right off the bat, which really shows how much I know_ [5]
about all of these subjects, and this comfort is part of what makes me 
good at teaching to all skill levels.

In addition to making class _very welcoming and fun_ [18], my emphasis on 
participation and examples leads to better understanding of both 
_conceptual ideas_ [21] and _homework problems_ [10].
Since students are constantly asking clarifying questions, they feel like 
I'm teaching them _what they want to know_ [14], which afterwards helps them 
_feel like they understand the topics_ [14]. Of course, this understanding 
has the side effect of helping students 
_pass midterms and do well on quizzes_ [15], which is also important.

As part of my dedication to providing _spectacular supplemental examples_ 
[16], whenever possible I 
_draw pictures and describe every detail of a problem_ [22]. I believe that 
geometric intuition is crucial to a deep understanding of mathematics, 
and as a teacher I place a lot of emphasis on translating fluently between 
the "syntax" of algebraic calculations and the "semantics" of geometric 
meaning behind those calculations. These geometric arguments often take the 
form of an _informal proof to begin with, and then afterwards a proper proof_ [5]
which helps students _fully understand the concept_ [5]. This 
_makes math much more interesting (and sometimes fun)... which makes 
learning the content more valuable_ [5].

I care deeply about my students, so I go _out of my way to provide_ resources 
for the class [6], and I provide _ample flexibility and encouragement with 
assignments, quizzes, and exams_ [6], since this is crucial for students to 
feel comfortable both in the course and with the material. I am 
_willing to do a ton of office hours throughout the week_ [2], which helps 
show students that their _education is important_ [2] to me. I always 
_make sure that everyone understands the material before moving on, and 
I take the time to explain whatever it is that they didn't understand_ [1].
This is yet another facet of my _patience with the million questions 
people have_ [11], and my commitment to showing students that they 
_can ask any questions, no matter how dumb they may be!_ [4], and I will 
always help them.

In all, I _just want the best for my students, and I will do as much as 
I can to make sure they succeed_ [17].

[1] (Fall 2021, 131-002 "Linear Algebra I", proof based)

Chris was an amazing TA with excellent teaching skills. They made sure 
that everyone was understanding the material before moving on, and they took 
the time to explain whatever it was that we didn't understand. They are very 
approachable and that is what me feel comfortable enough to converse with 
them and ask questions.


[2] (Fall 2021, 131-002 "Linear Algebra I", proof based)

Chris was an amazing TA. Given that the material seemed very abstract, 
they would always come with the best analogies of the content.
Lessons that were very unclear became easier to understand when they were 
explained. They were willing to do a ton of office hours throughout the week 
and I think they went even above what they had to do as a TA. I felt like 
my education was important to the TA and I was always comfortable asking for 
help.


[3] (Winter 2022, 165A-004 "Functions of a Complex Variable")

Chris is super helpful and excited about things mentioned in this 
course. Chris made it fun and interesting and their energy made it engaging
during discussion. This is the second time I had Chris as a TA and I am so 
thankful to have someone so knowledgeable in the course.


[4] (Winter 2022, 165A-002 "Functions of a Complex Variable")

Overall, Chris has been an amazing TA this quarter. They listen 
well to our questions as students and give good clarification when explaining
concepts in the class. Chris also makes the office hours and discussion 
sections feel comfortable and welcoming. I feel like I can ask any
questions, no matter how dumb they may be! I would love to have Chris as a 
TA for another class in the future.


[5] (Winter 2022, 136-002 "Introduction to the Theory of Numbers", proof based)

I think it is pretty amazing that the TA can help us with any 
question right off the bat, which really shows how much they know about the
subject, which I appreciate. They also understand that from a student's 
perspective, we need sort of an informal proof to begin with, and then
afterwards have a proper proof for us to dig deeper into the problem for us 
to fully understand the concept. They also have a demeanor that
makes discussions comfortable to be in, as well as enjoyable. They make 
math much more interesting (and sometimes fun) than it feels like it
is, which makes learning the content more valuable for me


[6] (Winter 2022, 136-002 "Introduction to the Theory of Numbers", proof based)

Chris is an excellent TA! Chris helped me tremendously with the 
assignments and with learning the course material. Chris went out of their
way to provide all the resources I needed to feel comfortable with the 
course material. Chris helped me a lot when I was sick. They provided
ample flexibility and encouragement with my assignments, quizzes, and exams. 
They gave me plenty of opportunities to excel in the course,
while I battled with my health-related symptoms. I would recommend Chris 
highly, and fully support them for their future endeavors.


[7] (Spring 2022, 9C-014 "Calculus")

Chris is wonderfully versed in mathematics and how it can be applied. 
They are excellent at helping students understand tough material
through the use of whiteboard writing and further explanation of the 
"bigger picture" of each math section. They also make the classroom
environment calm and are very approachable. My one critique for them is that 
they have the tendency to erase the white board a little too
quickly which sometimes leaves me unable to finish notes to its fullest extent. 


[8] (Spring 2022, 9C-014 "Calculus")

Chris was amazing! Their enthusiasm and just overall vibe were such a 
relatable thing and made discussion so much more enjoyable than it
already was! Their way of explaining and asking for questions made everyone 
feel involved and see if everyone understood the material we
went over. I also really like how our quizzes were based on what we 
went over that day so it wasn't a surprise or something we haven't
learned before. They also always gave us a confidence boost in this 
math class and wants to help us succeed. They were also very honest
about whether certain math theorems would be difficult or not and I 
appreciated that because it helped me gauge and get in the mindset of
what math problem I am about to do


[9] (Spring 2022, 9C-014 "Calculus")

Chris is amazing. They are really good. I enjoyed how enthusiastic they are 
about the subject and I love that they always explained where
things come from and why we should care. As a math major, I hope to be as 
enthusiastic and passionate about math as they are in the future


[10] (Spring 2022, 9C-014 "Calculus")

Chris was very helpful and always put students needs first when asking 
questions regarding lecture topics. They also did several homework
problems and structured the class in a way where it was beneficial to 
cover all material while still answering all of our questions.


[11] (Fall 2022, 133-02 "Geometry", proof based)

As always is nice and patient with the million questions 
people including myself have


[12] (Winter 2023, 6B-033 "Precalculus")

They were a good TA, made it easy to understand and comfortable to ask questions.


[13] (Winter 2023, 11-006 "Discrete Math", proof based)

Chris has been an extremely good TA, and they helped me learn the material 
in a far better way than in even the lecture or the homework
videos. They always put up some very helpful analogies, such as one I 
remember for induction proofs, and then they tried to connect material
to the real world, which helped make it much less abstract. Overall, Chris 
was an excellent TA who helped me thoroughly understand the
material, and I have no feedback/criticisms for them


[14] (Fall 2023, 7B-013 "Calculus for Life Sciences")

Chris is an Amazing TA. They are always available for office hours if we 
need help and is completely willing to go over and explain something
until we understand. They are approachable with office hours and questions, 
and overall a very nice person. Every class is started with
asking us if we have any questions, topics, or explanations we'd like to go 
over. The discussion is geared toward what we want to know. I
have been in classes where the same material in class has been covered, but 
I never felt like I understood the topis until now. Chris
remembers what it was like to be one of us, their explanations are incredibly 
helpful. When I cannot understand the professor's explanation, I
know I can count on Chris. This also makes the class want to respect them and 
listen. We know Chris cares. Overall, a very very helpful TA
and a great learning experience. 


[15] (Fall 2023, 7B-013 "Calculus for Life Sciences")

Hi, Chris! I just want to say you are the best TA I have ever had in college 
thus far (I'm in my third year now), and you helped me understand
calculus a lot better than I ever thought I could. Because of you, I was 
about to pass the midterm and do well on quizzes, and I am horrible at
math. Thank you so much for your kindness and help. Keep doing what you are 
doing! 


[16] (Fall 2023, 7B-013 "Calculus for Life Sciences")

Chris is the best TA I've ever seen. Provided great learning, and spectacular 
supplemental examples, while making a comfortable learning
environment for their students 


[17] (Fall 2023, 7B-012 "Calculus for Life Sciences")

Chris is an incredibly kind, approachable, and friendly TA! They make sure to 
put the needs of the students first, and always asks what types
of problems that students are stuck on so that they can prioritize and manage 
the class time that we have together. They also always check
in with the class while they are reteaching the lecture material so that 
they can immediately explain any unclear points. Chris is very receptive
to questions, and encourages us to go to their office hours if they have any 
further confusion. Overall, it is clear that Chris just wants the best
for us students, and they will do as much as they can to make sure we succeed


[18] (Fall 2023, 7B-012 "Calculus for Life Sciences")

This class was quite literally the only class I look forward to going. 
Chris has made their classroom environment very welcoming and fun. The
only thing I’d say is the GradeScope process can be inconvenient sometimes 
since it never works properly, but that is out of their control


[19] (Winter 2024, 11-003 "Discrete Math", proof based)

Chris was a great TA. They helped clarify material by the professor and 
showed helpful examples to supplement it as well. They provided a
safe and comfortable learning environment that allowed me to ask 
questions and take part in discussion. Chris also had great knoweledge
and enthusiam for the math, providing examples and giving history on 
certian topics


[20] (Spring 2024, 10B-021 "Calculus of Several Variables II")

Excellent TA, clear and concise while also allowing anyone to 
mention their problems. Model instructor


[21] (Spring 2024, 10B-021 "Calculus of Several Variables II")

Very effective instructor. Clear and concise explanations behind concepts. 
Amazing at clarifying underlying conceptual ideas behind the
math, and would wonderfully visualize them for us via drawings. 
Even during times of silence within class, Chris is always there to support us
and will offer us clean work behind homework problems and etc. I'm sadden, 
personally, as I may never see Chris again, as they were one of
the most enjoyable TAs I have ever had. They made me enjoy math again &lt;3


[22] (Spring 2024, 10B-004 "Calculus of Several Variables II")

Chris helped explain course materials, homework, and lectures. 
The best part was Chris would draw pictures and describe every detail of the
problem which helped me understand the question. Chris's explaining helped me 
understand this course.
