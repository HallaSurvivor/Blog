I really like the clean white background with pale accent colors aesthetic.
Lots of whitespace, etc.

[sheaves.github.io](https://sheaves.github.io) is a very simple blog that looks good,
and you can actually see the jekyll code
[here](https://github.com/sheaves/sheaves.github.io).

Here's another one that I like, but this website doesn't really exist,
so I can't directly link it to you :(

You probably remember [maayanalbert.com](https://maayanalbert.com), but I also think that design is
extremely cool.
