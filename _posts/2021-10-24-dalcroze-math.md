title: A Dalcroze Approach to Math Pedagogy

Recently I received an email from a reader, who asked if I had any ideas to get
highschoolers excited about math. Precisely, I was asked:

> How can I and my kids get beyond the basics to the more playful/creative side of math? 
> Is this possible with their current level: basic computation skills plus around 
> 9th grade level of algebra? 

This is a _fantastic_ question, and I'm flattered that someone reached out to
ask a question which is so close to my heart. It tells me I must be doing 
_something_ right with this blog, and I'm proud to have a community 
(however small) which fosters questions like this.

I have a lot of opinionsâ„¢ about pedagogy, many of which are informed by my 
experiences with [Dalcroze Eurhythmics][1] at CMU. Dalcroze pedagogy is a huge
subject, but two of the major takeaways are

1. We can learn effectively by finding the "play" in what we do
2. Classes should be structured to teach multiple topics, in varying depth,
simultaneously. This way students can focus on the lessons which is at the 
right level for wherever they are currently.

These are superficially more suited to a music class than a math class. 
After all, with the exception of early harmony classes, there are fewer 
"right" and "wrong" answers in music. The experience of music-making is much
more subjective, with broad variations in process from person to person, and 
there aren't as many people taking a music class because it's required for their
otherwise unrelated major. One might contrast this with a typical calculus class,
where the emphasis is typically placed on correctly carrying out certain 
computations, oftentimes being railroaded through a _particular path_ to that solution,
and there are many engineers and chemists and businesspeople in the making who
are forced to take the class (possibly against their will).

I would argue that this is a failure on a lot of levels, mainly bureaucratic,
and that calculus classes don't _need_ to be run like this. That said, even if
a large scale reform of our early math curriculum is needed 
(and many people say it is TODO: link a few articles from other math educators)
the graduate mathematics experience is much more akin to the experience of a
musician.

Mathematics, at the end of the day, is about finding truth and solving problems. 
Both of these involve deeply personal processes, and just as different musicians
prefer different styles of music, or practice differently, or even take different
interpretations of the same piece, different mathematicians prefer different
kinds of problems, study and internalize math in different ways, and might even 
solve the same problem in entirely different ways! In this way, the experience
of doing mathematics is much more similar to the experience of making music than
a calculus class would lead you to believe.

TODO: provide examples of all of these phenomena?
TODO: link the blog post about how math and music require similar skills

All this to say, I think that the ideas of Dalcroze pedagogy can be well applied
to mathematical education, and while this is politically easiest to do at the
graduate level, I'm sure it would be beneficial for all students.

Dalcroze eurhythmics spends a lot of time playing games, and letting students
learn from the game whatever they're ready to. I've spent some time thinking
about how we can do the same thing in mathematics. If you're new to higher
math[^1], these might not even _look_ like mathematics, but this is really an
issue with what we as a society decide to emphasize in schools. I'm reminded 
of the following excellent quote:

> TODO: find the quote about highschool math being analogous to only reading
> cookbooks in english class, and cite the OP

With the introduction out of the way, let's see some mathematical games we might play!

TODO: Should these be multiple posts in a series? That would be more modular,
and would let me get this up sooner/add more examples later...

## Fold and Cut

- demo
- "easy" to "hard" shapes to cut out
- what happens if there are "holes" in the region?
- _why_ does this always work, intuitively?
- can you come up with an algorithm to always solve this problem?
  - link the website that solves this problem

## Sperner's Lemma

- demo
-

---

## Set

---

## An example from higher math too

TODO: talk about how we play games in abstract math as well, it's just that
the rules are more complicated.

---

## An example from calculus

TODO: out of spite, show how we might teach a concept from calculus in this
way as well

    If you are new to higher math, welcome to my blog! 
    I'm sorry the bulk of my posts probably come off as quite intimidating,
    but that's just because my target audience is people with some experience!
    With time and effort, anyone can understand anything I write ^_^.
