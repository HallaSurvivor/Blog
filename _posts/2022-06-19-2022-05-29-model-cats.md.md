title: What are Model Categories?
tags:

In the [sister post] TODO: link to this one, we spent some time building up
the notion of a "homotopy theory", which we encoded by the notion of a 
[Relative Category][1] $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{W})$. 
In this setting we're often interested in the localization 
$\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$, but this category can be very badly 
behaved, and we introduced the language of $\infty$-categories in order
to combat this issue. But how can we actually _compute_ with our favorite
$\infty$-category?
The answer is by putting a [Model Structure][2] on $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{W})$
and in this post we'll talk about what that means.

First, what _is_ a model structure? 

Recall a <span class=defn>Relative Category</span> is a category 
$\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a family $\mathcal{W}$ of arrows, called the
_weak equivalences_, which we want to think of as "morally invertible"[^1].

We should probably say a few words about the intuition for fibrations and
cofibrations.

A _fibration_ $f$ is an arrow that's easy to "lift" into:

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p>

For instance, covering spaces and bundles are examples of fibrations in 
topology. Algebraically, there's a model structure where a map of chains of 
$R$-modules $f : A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is a fibration if each $f_n$ is a surjection.

Dually, a _cofibration_ $i$ is an arrow that's easy to "extend" out of:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/homotopy-of-homotopies/cofibration.png" width="30%">
</p>

We should think of a cofibration as being a subspace inclusion 
$A \hookrightarrow X$ where $A$ "sits nicely" inside of $X$.

For instance, the inclusion arrow of a "good pair" is a cofibration. Thus
inclusion maps of subcomplexes of a simplicial/CW/etc. complex are cofibrations. 
More generally, any subspace inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ where $A$ is a 
[nieghborhood deformation retract][23] in $X$ will be a cofibration.

Algebraically, the same model structure as before thinks that a map 
$f : A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is a cofibration exactly when each $f_n$ is an
injection whose cokernel is projective.

Precisely, these triangles are really special cases of squares. In the 
fibration case, the left side of the square is the unique map from the 
initial object to $A$. Dually, in the cofibration case the right 
hand side of the square should really be the unique map from $Y$ to the 
terminal object. 

This lets us unify these diagrams into a single axiom, which says that
a square of the form

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/homotopy-of-homotopies/full-square.png" width="30%">
</p>

has a lift whenever $i$ is a cofibration, $f$ is a fibration, and one of $i$
or $f$ is a weak equivalence.

[^1]:
    The primordial example is the category $\mathsf{Top}$ of topological spaces,
    where $\mathcal{W}$ are the (weak) homotopy equivalences. Then after 
    inverting all the arrows in $\mathcal{W}$, we're left with $\mathsf{hTop}$,
    the category of topological spaces up to (weak) homotopy equivalence.
