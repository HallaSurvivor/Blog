title: What are Model Categories?

In the [sister post] TODO: link to this one, we spent some time building up
the notion of a "homotopy theory", which we encoded by the notion of a 
[Relative Category][1] $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{W})$. 
In this setting we're often interested in the localization 
$\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$, but this category can be very badly 
behaved, and we introduced the language of $\infty$-categories in order
to combat this issue. But how can we actually _compute_ with our favorite
$\infty$-category?
The answer is by putting a [Model Structure][2] on $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{W})$
and in this post we'll talk about what that means.

First, what _is_ a model structure? 

Recall a <span class=defn>Relative Category</span> is a category 
$\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a family $\mathcal{W}$ of arrows, called the
_weak equivalences_, which we want to think of as "morally invertible"[^1].

Roughly, to put a model structure on $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{W})$ is to 
choose two new subfamilies of arrows: the 
<span class=defn>fibrations</span> and the <span class=defn>cofibrations</span>.
We then define the "nice" subclasses of objects: 

- $X$ is called <span class=defn>fibrant</span> if the unique arrow to the 
    terminal object is a fibration
- $X$ is called <span class=defn>cofibrant</span> if the unique arrow from 
    the initial object is a cofibration
- $X$ is called <span class=defn>bifibrant</span> if it is both fibrant and cofibrant

Then we have axioms[^12] which imply that every object is weakly equivalent to a
bifibrant object. Since, after localizing, our 
weak equivalences become isomorphisms, this means we can restrict attention to
the bifibrant objects... But why bother?

It's a theorem that we have _excellent_ control over the maps between 
bifibrant objects in the localization! In fact, there's a notion of
"homotopy" between maps, which is entirely analogous to the notion of 
homotopy in topology, and maps $X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$
between bifibrant objects
are exactly homotopy classes of maps from $X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$!

Thus, a very common way we use model structures to perform computations is by
first replacing the objects we want to compute with by weakly equivalent 
bifibrant ones. For instance, we might replace a module by its injective 
resolution. Then maps in the homotopy category $\mathcal{C}[\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$ 
are just maps in $\mathcal{C}$ up to homotopy[^13]! 

This is made even more useful by the existence of _multiple_ model structures
on $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{W})$. Depending on the computation, we might choose
one model structure over another in order to make our lives as simple as possible.

Another reason is to help us understand when 
$\mathcal{C}_1[\mathcal{W}_1^{-1}] \simeq \mathcal{C}_2[\mathcal{W}_2^{-1}]$.
Indeed, there's a notion of [Quillen Equivalence][24], which is quite 
easy to work with, and which guarantees that two model categories have the
same homotopy theory[^14].

For example, the earlier example of $\mathsf{Top}$ and $s\mathsf{Set}$,
which have the same homotopy theory, comes from a quillen equivalence.
See [here][29], for instance.

We should probably say a few words about the intuition for fibrations and
cofibrations.

A _fibration_ $f$ is an arrow that's easy to "lift" into:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/homotopy-of-homotopies/fibration.png" width="30%">
</p>

For instance, covering spaces and bundles are examples of fibrations in 
topology. Algebraically, there's a model structure where a map of chains of 
$R$-modules $f : A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is a fibration if each $f_n$ is a surjection.

Dually, a _cofibration_ $i$ is an arrow that's easy to "extend" out of:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/homotopy-of-homotopies/cofibration.png" width="30%">
</p>

We should think of a cofibration as being a subspace inclusion 
$A \hookrightarrow X$ where $A$ "sits nicely" inside of $X$.

For instance, the inclusion arrow of a "good pair" is a cofibration. Thus
inclusion maps of subcomplexes of a simplicial/CW/etc. complex are cofibrations. 
More generally, any subspace inclusion $A \hookrightarrow X$ where $A$ is a 
[nieghborhood deformation retract][23] in $X$ will be a cofibration.

Algebraically, the same model structure as before thinks that a map 
$f : A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is a cofibration exactly when each $f_n$ is an
injection whose cokernel is projective.

<br>

Precisely, these triangles are really special cases of squares. In the 
fibration case, the left side of the square is the unique map from the 
initial object to $A$. Dually, in the cofibration case the right 
hand side of the square should really be the unique map from $Y$ to the 
terminal object. 

This lets us unify these diagrams into a single axiom, which says that
a square of the form

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/homotopy-of-homotopies/full-square.png" width="30%">
</p>

has a lift whenever $i$ is a cofibration, $f$ is a fibration, and one of $i$
or $f$ is a weak equivalence.

[^12]:
    I don't want to get into the precise details of a model structure here, 
    but you can (and should!) read more in Dwyer and Spalinski's excellent 
    introduction _Homotopy Theory and Model Categories_, available 
    [here][12], for instance. 

    There's also Mazel-Gee's _The Zen of $\infty$-Categories_, avaialable 
    [here][13], and Kantor's survey _Model Categories: Theory and Applications_,
    available [here][14].

    While we're at it, there's also Goerss and Schemmerhorn's 
    _Model Categories and Simplicial Methods_ ([here][15]), Hovey's book
    ([here][16]), and MO questions [here][17], [here][18], [here][19], and
    [here][20]. There's also Ponto and May's _More Concise Algebraic Topology_
    ([here][21]), but at some point I should stop.

    For an example of this idea in action, see [this][22] answer of mine.

[^14]:
    In fact, this is true 
    in a stronger way than we currently have the language to describe.
    Not only are the localizations (read: homotopy categories) equivalent,
    but actually the presented $\infty$-categories are equivalent too!

[^1]:
    The primordial example is the category $\mathsf{Top}$ of topological spaces,
    where $\mathcal{W}$ are the (weak) homotopy equivalences. Then after 
    inverting all the arrows in $\mathcal{W}$, we're left with $\mathsf{hTop}$,
    the category of topological spaces up to (weak) homotopy equivalence.
