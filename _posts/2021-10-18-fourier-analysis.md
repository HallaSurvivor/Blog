As promised, here is the final chapter in my [series][1] on organizing my
thoughts for the real analysis qualifying exam at UCR. Today we'll be talking 
about [Fourier Theory][2], with a focus on actually _using_ the theory, as well
as some discussion of the natural followup to these ideas: 
[Abstract Harmonic Analysis][3]

We'll start with the case of fourier analysis on $S^1$:

TODO: 
 - $S^1$
     - $L^2$ functions
     - The fourier transform
     - How do properties of $f$ relate to properties of $\hat{f}$?
        - e.g. $L^1$ implies bounded at $\infty$ (Riemann-Lebesgue)
        - there MUST be others... Smoothness?
     - Give rules for computation:
        - product, derivative, etc.
     - Compute some examples
        - eg 1
        - eg 2
     - Inverse FT
        - is every sequence the FT of _something_? (No)
     - Solving a _concrete_ problem

  - $\mathbb{R}$
     - $L^1$ functions
     - The fourier transform
     - How do properties of $f$ relate to properties of $\hat{f}$?
        - e.g. $L^1$ implies bounded at $\infty$ (Riemann-Lebesgue)
     - Give rules for computation:
        - product, derivative, etc.
        - mention Schwarz functions in a footnote? "Everything nice happens"
     - Compute some examples
        - eg 1
        - eg 2
     - Inverse FT
        - is every sequence the FT of _something_? (No)
     - Solving a concrete problem (ode/pde)
     - Mention Parseval's Extension to $L^2$

  - These look _really_ similar... Is there something more general?
     - Yes! Abstract Harmonic Analysis
     - LCH abelian groups
     - Discrete FT

  - Go back to old posts and make sure you didn't forget anything you promised 
      you'd bring up in this post
