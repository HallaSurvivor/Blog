Welcome to the inaugural post of this blog! As a quick preface, I plan
to post about math, particularly math that I'm struggling with, and hopefully
we can work through some stuff together ^_^.
I've noticed there can be a lack of examples in many areas that I've been
interested in, and I hope to use this blog as a repository of examples that
have helped me, and that were possibly difficult for me to come across. 
I also spend a lot of time thinking about math, and sometimes I have thoughts
that I'm particularly excited about. Some of the posts here will be about
those. These posts might be about research, classwork, or general observations
that I want to make sure I write somewhere. 

Whenever possible, I'll try to include [sage](sagemath.org) code with 
computational examples of whatever we're discussing. I think sage is a
fantastic resource for learning and doing mathematics, but I haven't seen
many people talking about how they actually use it in the wild. Hopefully
this blog is a starting point to remedy that. I'm far from a sage expert,
but hopefully we can learn together.

Lastly, this post is being written before the design of this website is
complete. I'm able to do that because the phenomenal 
[Remy Davison](https://remydavison.com/) is responsible for making this site 
look as good as I'm sure it does by the time you're reading this. I'm super 
grateful for both his friendship and his skills. Ok - onto the math.
