In the [last post](/2020/08/16/raag-defn) we talked about 
Right Angled Artin Groups and how the construction is functorial.
Of course, to even _talk_ about a functor, we need to know what categories
the raag construction moves between. Obviously it outputs a group, and the
category $\mathsf{Grp}$ of groups is fairly unambiguous. The domain, though,
should be a category of graphs, and this is a more subtle point. There are 
_lots_ of options for a category of graphs in the literature, and the one
you pick matters quite a bit. In this post I'll summarize the main ones,
as well as their similarities and differences, so that we can have a better
idea of what categorical constructions are available to us when we study
the raag functor.

As a tl;dr for future reference here is a table summarizing the various
categories. For a more in depth descritpion, one category at a time, 
keep reading. 

âš  Warning: It seems like the names for the various categories is pretty 
nonstandard. I've chosen names that I think are memorable, and I've tried to
agree with any consensus that I'm aware of. If you're reading a paper, make
sure you know which category people are talking about. I'm sure I'm missing
many common ones - these are just the ones that I find myself reaching for
intuitively. For a slew of other options, see these pages on the nlab
