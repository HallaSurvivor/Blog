In the [last post](/2020/08/16/raag-defn) we talked about 
Right Angled Artin Groups and gave some basic examples. At the end, I
asserted that this construction is functorial, but I didn't show it.
This is because, to even _talk_ about functoriality, we need to know what categories
the raag construction moves between. Obviously it outputs a group, and the
category $\mathsf{Grp}$ of groups is fairly unambiguous. The domain, though,
should be a category of graphs, and this is a more subtle point. There are 
_lots_ of options for a category of graphs in the literature, and the one
you pick matters quite a bit. In this post I'll summarize the ones that I'm
most drawn to, as well as their similarities and differences. 
This way we can have a better idea of what categorical constructions are 
available to us when we study the raag functor.

As a tl;dr for future reference here is a table summarizing the various
categories. For a more in depth descritpion, one category at a time, 
keep reading. 

âš  Warning: It seems like the names for the various categories is pretty 
nonstandard. I've chosen names that I think are memorable, but 
if you're reading a paper, make sure you know which category the authors 
are talking about. I'm also missing plenty of categories that people have
considered -- these are just the ones that I find myself reaching for 
intuitively. For a zoo of other options, see these pages on the nlab

$\mathsf{DiGph}$
================

We're starting here, because the objects are as simple as possible. Everything
else (except quivers) will be a variation on this theme. Because of that, 
I'll define a lot of terms here that will end up being used later as well.

The objects of $\mathsf{DiGph}$ are pairs $(V,E)$ where $E \subseteq V \times V$ 
is _any_ relation. We visualize these by drawing a (directed!) arrow from
$v_1$ to $v_2$ whenever $(v_1, v_2) \in E$. Notably, there is nothing preventing
$(v,v) \in E$, and so we might have _self-loops_ connecting a vertex to itself.

As a quick example, if $V = \{a,b,c\}$ and $E = \{(a,a), (a,b), (b,c), (c,b)\}$,
then we would depict this as the following digraph:

![example digraph](/assets/images/graph-cats/example-digraph.png)

The morphisms of this category are the _structure preserving maps_, and this
theme is very common (both for the rest of this post, and in mathematics more broadly).
More explicitly, a morphism from $(V,E)$ to $(W,F)$ is a function $f : V \to W$ 
with the bonus property $(v_1, v_2) \in E \Longrightarrow (f(v_1),f(v_2)) \in F$.

$\mathsf{DiGph}$ is categorically excellent, in large part because of 
its intimate relationship with $\mathsf{Set}$. Indeed, $\mathsf{DiGph}$
is [topologically concrete](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topological+concrete+category),
which (among other things) means it has all limits and colimits. Of course,
it would be nice to know how to _compute_ (co)limits, whether or not we 
abstractly know they exist. 

For this, let $U$ be the <span class="defn">forgetful functor</span> that sends a 
digraph $(V,E)$ to its underlying set $V$. Then $U$ admits both a left _and_ 
a right adjoint, and these will let us compute (co)ilmits in practice!
The <span class="defn">discrete functor</span> $D$ sends a set $X$ to the digraph 
$(X,\emptyset)$, and dually the <span class="defn">indiscrete functor</span> 
$I$ sends a set $X$ to the graph $(X,X^2)$. 

<div class="boxed">
If it's not obvious, verifying $D \dashv U \dashv I$ is a great exercise!
Remember that functions on digraphs have to preserve the relation, but
for $DX$ there's nothing to preserve, and $IX$ already has all the relations!
</div>

Since $U$ is both a right _and_ a left adjoint, it preserves limits _and_ colimits!
So the vertex set of a (co)limit of digraphs is exactly the (co)limit of the
vertex set! Thus we can compute (co)limits of digraphs by figuring out
the vertex set, then guessing the edge relation. In general, in limits you
want to keep all of the edges you are allowed to keep, and in colimits you 
should keep only the edges you're forced to.

Let's see an example of this in action:

The product of two graphs $(V,E)$ and $(W,F)$ must have $V \times W$ as its
vertex set. So we need to know when $(v_1,w_1)$ is related to $(v_2,w_2)$.
Since $\pi_V$ has to be a morphism, there can't be a relation between
$(v_1,x)$ and $(v_2,y)$ unless $(v_1, v_2) \in E$. Symmetrically,
there can't be any relations between $(x,w_1)$ and $(y,w_2)$ unless a 
relation already exists between $w_1$ and $w_2$. Thus we can only have
an edge $(v_1,w_1)$ to $(v_2,w_2)$ if $(v_1,v_2) \in E$ and $(w_1,w_2) \in F$.
Moreoever, we know that the product should be _maximal_ among those graphs who 
see $(V,E)$ and $(W,F)$. So we must have all of the relations that we are 
permitted. Thus, the above condition is _exactly_ the condition for edges:

$$
(V,E) \times (W,F) = 
\big ( V \times W, \quad \{((v_1,w_1),(v_2,w_2)) ~|~ (v_1,v_2) \in E \land (w_1,w_2) \in F\} \big )
$$

<div class="boxed">
If you want to play around with the "guess-and-check" method, 
what should the coproducts be? What about the initial and terminal objects?
For bonus-points, draw a (manageable) diagram and compute its limit and
colimit.
</div>

In fact, $\mathsf{DiGph}$ enjoys even more structure! It is 
<span class="defn">Cartesian Closed</span> and has a kind of
<span class="defn">Subobject Classifier</span>. While there is 
plenty of [abstract nonsense](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/511517/pullbacks-and-pushouts-in-the-category-of-digraphs/512832#512832)
to justify these claims, it's nice to see a concrete description of
these objects too. In the interest of conciseness, I'll simply state 
the construction, and I'll leave it to you to verify the relevant properties.

Given two digraphs $(V,E)$ and $(W,F)$, their <span class="defn">Exponential Graph</span>
is given by 

$$(W,F)^{(V,E)} = \big (\{ f : V \to W \}, \quad \{ (f,g) ~|~ \forall v_1, v_2. (v_1, v_2) \in E \Longrightarrow (f v_1, g v_2) \in F \} \big )$$

<div class="boxed">
To check that this deserves the name "exponential", you should check that
$ - \times (V,E) \dashv (-)^{(V,E)}$
</div>

The subobject classifier should identify a full subgraph with its
characteristic function. Since we need to map edges to edges, 
we are forced into the following structure:

![subobject classifier](/assets/images/graph-cats/digraph-subobject-classifier.png)

The mono $T$ (for true) is given by the inclusion of the full subgraph with
vertex $1$ and its self loop.

$\mathsf{Gph}$
==============

Now that we have a lot of discussion and example computations out of the way, 
this section will feel extremely quick! This is mainly because
computations in $\mathsf{Gph}$ are exactly the same as 
computations in $\mathsf{DiGph}$.

$\mathsf{Gph}$ has objects $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set and
$E$ is a _symmetric_ relation on $V$. The arrows are still the
functions which preserve the edge relation. Indeed, we can view
$\mathsf{Gph}$ as a full (in fact, reflective[^1]) subcategory of $\mathsf{DiGph}$.
By requiring the relations be symmetric, we are getting rid of the "directed"
nature of the edges. Now instead of having a connection from $a$ to $b$,
we simply have a connection between $a$ and $b$.

[^1]: The reflector is the "symmetrization" functor that adds in $(b,a)$ for every $(a,b) \in E$.

$\mathsf{Gph}$ is every bit as nice as $\mathsf{DiGph}$, as its 
forgetful functor _also_ admits a chain of adjunctions $D \dashv U \dashv I$.
Notice in particular that $\emptyset, X^2 \subseteq X^2$ are both already
symmetric relations. Because of this, we can compute limits and colimits
with the exact same guess-and-check method as before! 

Additionally, $\mathsf{Gph}$ is cartesian closed, with the same exponential,
and has the same subobject classifier too!

<div class="boxed">
Why is 
$(W,F)^{(V,E)} = \big ( \{ f : V \to W \}, \quad \{(f,g) ~|~ \forall v_1, v_2. (v_1,v_2) \in E \Longrightarrow (f v_1, g v_2) \in F \} \big )$
symmetric whenever $E$ and $F$ are?
