Last week [Jacob][1] asked me to give a talk in the topology seminar for UCR. 
I've been pretty busy lately, but I have a reputation to uphold, so I agreed,
even though I didn't have a great idea of what I wanted to talk about. 
My first idea was to talk about [modal logic][2], which admits a nice topological
semantics, but I wasn't able to come up with any ways the logic was able to
give us extra information topologically. It was always to topology helping to
say things about the logic, and that's not really the direction I wanted the
ideas to flow for this talk. I considered talking about [locales][3], but
I'm still not super familiar with locales and I was worried I wouldn't be able
to answer some of the questions that might get asked. Most worryingly, I don't
have a good answer for "why should I care?". I personally think locales are 
cool, and there's good reasons to care if you're already sold on 
constructive mathematics and toposes... But it's hard to justify to a generic
mathematician on the street[^1]. Eventually, I settled on 
<span class=defn>Descriptive Combinatorics</span>, an extremely interesting
topic in its own right, and one which has lots of interesting ties to 
[geometric group theory][5].

So then, what did we talk about?

We started with the definition of a graph as $G \subseteq X \times X$, and
a ($k$-)coloring as a function $c : X \to k$ so that $x G y \implies cx \neq cy$.
Then we proved a graph is $2$-colorable if and only if it has no odd cycles. 
This is a classical result in combinatorics, and we can pass to the setting
of infinite graphs by using the axiom of choice 
(we could use a compactness argument, but maybe it's easier to _choose_ 
a starting vertex from each connected component). The fact that we need AC, 
though, tells us that our coloring is "nonconstructive", and it's natural to
ask if there's a constructive way to get such a coloring... But what does that
even mean?

Enter [Descriptive Set Theory][6], which has a lot of tools for showing what
constructions are "definable", and which has a preexisting language for 
discussing these kinds of problems. The idea is to say something is definable
provided we can build it in a measurable way[^2]. This is loosely inspired by 
the famous [Solovay Model][8], which shows that we _need_ AC in order to build
nonmeasurable things. So if we're able to build something in a measurable way,
it's (_very_ informally) reasonable to say it must be "definable"[^3]. 

So now we move to the natural setting for descriptive set theory: we work with
a [polish space][10] $X$ with a graph $G \subseteq X \times X$, that we now
require to be borel. I gave some examples of polish spaces to show that they're
extremely common[^4], and then asked if a borel graph $G$ with no odd cycles
must have a borel $2$ coloring. The answer, it turns out, is _no_!

The proof is quick if you know some ergodic theory[^5]:

$\ulcorner$
Let $T : S^1 \to S^1$ be an irrational rotation by some angle $\alpha$. 
Now let $G \subseteq S^1 \times S^1$ so that $x G y \iff x = y \pm \alpha$.

Then $G$ decomposes $S^1$ as continuum many copies of the cayley graph of 
$\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, there are no odd cycles. But if we had a 
decomposition of $S^1$ into two lebesgue measurable color classes, say $R$ and $B$,
then we have a problem.

First, notice $m(R) = m(B)$, since $T$ is measure preserving and swaps $R$ and $B$.
Moreover, notice $T^2(R) = R$ and $T^2$ is ergodic. So $R$ must either be 
null or co-null. But if $R$ and $B$ are null, then they can't cover $S^1$,
and if $R$ and $B$ are co-null, they must intersect.
<span style="float:right">$\lrcorner$</span>

This shows there is no lebesgue measurable $2$-coloring of this graph,
and thus no borel coloring. A similar argument shows that there is
no baire measurable coloring either. Notice that we have to _choose_ a 
basepoint for each of our cayley graphs of $\mathbb{Z}$, because our orbits
are really [torsors][14] (which are to groups as [affine spaces][15] are
to vector spaces).

I ended the talk with a natural question: Why should we care? 

<img src="/assets/images/bring-out-the-crayons/potato.jpg" width="50%">

I'm interested in descriptive combinatorics because I think it's cool to see 
what changes between the finite case and the infinite case when we require
things to be definable. But I understand that not everybody likes combinatorics
for its own sake, and since this seminar has a lot of geometric group theorists,
I wanted to show them why they might care. Thankfully, I remember watching
[a talk][12] a while ago which has a nice application to [amenabilitiy][13].
This is a bit more broad than definable colorings 
(we're looking at definable matchings instead), but it's a similar flavor.

So I recalled the definition of a paradoxical decomposition, and showed that
we can paradoxically decompose the cayley graph of $F_2$. See the picture
below[^6]:

<img src="/assets/images/bring-out-the-crayons/paradoxical.jpg" width="50%">

We can use just the left and right pieces (or indeed just the top and bottom)
to reconstruct the entire graph. See this picture[^7] 
(and try to ignore the fact that the roles of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have 
swapped with the roles of $a$ and $b$... This is what I get for lazily 
frankensteining other people's graphics together).

<img src="/assets/images/bring-out-the-crayons/paradoxical_2.svg" width="50%">

Translating the left piece by $a$ and then combining it with the right piece
gives the entire space. Similarly, translating the bottom piece by $b$ and
combining it with the top piece gives the entire space too! So we were able
to break our space into $5$ pieces, move them around, and get two copies of
our space!

It turns out that this is basically the Banach-Tarski Paradox! We let $F_2$
act freely on $S^2$. Then this decomposes $S^2$ into an uncountable disjoint
union of orbits, each of which looks like the cayley graph of $F_2$. So by 
running the above decomposition simultaneously in each orbit 
(using AC to _choose_ a basepoint in each torsor again) we get the desired 
decomposition. 

To finish up, I showed how this decomposition 
(and thus concepts like amenable groups and paradoxical decompositions)
can be linked to descriptive combinatorics:

Let $a : \Gamma \curvearrowright X$ be an action of a group $\Gamma$ on a space $X$. 
Then for $S$ a finite subset of $\Gamma$, we can form the graph $G(a,S)$
whose vertex set is $X \sqcup X \sqcup X$ and where we connect a point 
$x$ in the first copy of $X$ to _both_ the points $\gamma x$ in each of the
other two copies of $X$ for every $\gamma \in S$. This is a kind of bipartite
cayley graph, and it's interesting because perfect matchings in $G(a,S)$ are in
bijection with paradoxical decompositions of $X$ 
(where we promise to only translate the pieces by elements in $S$).

In particular, if we want to study _definable_ paradoxical decompositions
(say, lebesgue measurable ones), then we can study lebesgue measurable perfect
matchings in $G(a,S)$ instead, and we've cashed out a tricky problem in 
geometric group theory for a tricky problem in borel combinatorics. But,
at least for me, the combinatorial problem is easier to think about.
If you want to hear more about all this, the set of Andrew Marks talks
I linked earlier ([here][12] it is again) goes into much more detail about all
of this. There's also a [wonderful survey][18] by Kechris and Marks.

All in all, it was a fun talk to give! The audience was pretty tired, but I got
some good questions, which is always nice. I love descriptive combinatorics,
and giving this talk reminded me that I should go and read more about it. 
I haven't really thought about this stuff since taking Clinton Conley's
Descriptive Set Theory class.... Almost three years ago now. It's a shame too,
because there's a lot of _really_ interesting stuff to think about!

As usual, here's the title and abstract:

Bring Out the Crayons: A Survey of Descriptive Combinatorics

At the interface of topology, logic, and combinatorics, there lies a 
beautiful source of problems. In today's talk, I'll explain what 
descriptive combinatorics is all about, and survey some results in the area.

[^1]:
    The best I have I found in Johnstone's [_The Point of Pointless Topology_][4].

    Let $X$ be some topological space, and consider $\mathsf{Sh}(X)$,
    the topos of sheaves on $X$.

    Compact regular locales in $\mathsf{Sh}(X)$ correspond to
    proper maps $Y \to X$. So any proof about locales that's constructive
    (and most are) will go through inside this topos. In particular, 
    the Stone-ÄŒech Compactification for locales tells us that we can embed
    $Y \hookrightarrow Z$ as locales in $\mathsf{Sh}(X)$. But unpacking this
    means we get a commutative triangle 

    <img src="/assets/images/bring-out-the-crayons/triangle.png" width="50%">

    where our map $Y \to X$ factors (universally) through the proper map $Z \to X$.

[^2]:
    Here "measurable" can mean a few things. Possibly $\mu$-measurable for some
    measure, but borel-measurable and baire-measurable are two equally common 
    choices. There's also [analytic][7], etc., but in the talk today I focused
    on $\mu$, borel, and baire measurability.

[^3]:
    I suspect there are other, more precise connections 
    (for instance, to do with the [boldface/lightface hierarchies][9]), but I 
    know disappointingly little about these things, so I can't say for sure.

[^4]:
    $\mathbb{R}$, $[0,1]$, $(0,1)$, $S^1$, and every manifold are polish.
    Moreover, we have $2^\omega$ and $\omega^\omega$, and I think I stopped here.

[^5]:
    And can be found in a great paper 
    [_Brooks' Theorem for Measurable Colorings_][11] by Conley, Marks,
    and Tucker-Drob.

[^6]:
    That I shamelessly stole from [here][16]

[^7]:
    Shamelessly stolen from wikipedia [here][17], which I feel less bad about.
