title: Self Similarity in Category Theory

In Category Theory it's often the case that structured categories 
"look like" their objects. This has been noticed before, by 
John Baez and others, but I wanted to write up a quick post with a 
few examples. 

In general "small" categories look like things, and "big" categories have 
things inside them


1. 2-categories are generalized categories, but also the objects of a 
fixed 2-category can be thought of as categories in their own right
(this is the birth of formal category theory)

2. a topos is a generalized space (see petit topoi, for instance), but 
also the objects of a fixed topos can be though of as spaces in their own right
(see, for instance, objects in a gros topos)

3. an abelian category is a generalized abelian group, and its objects are as well

4. A category is a kind of generalized set (it has comparison between its objects),
but also a universe whose objects are generalized sets

etc.
