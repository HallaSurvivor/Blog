I'm starting my PhD at UC Riverside this fall, and I've enrolled in a program
that introduces me to some faculty and gets me familiar with the campus...
Or, it would were it not for covid. Regardless, I've been meeting
with a summer advisor ([Matt Durham](https://sites.google.com/view/mgdurham/))
over zoom every week for a while now to talk about
hyperbolic surfaces and mapping class groups. I'm not sure I'm ready to make
a blog post about that material, but last week we talked about
Right Angled Artin Groups (RAAGs), which arise as subgroups
of mapping class groups in a very natural way
(cf. [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1118) by Thomas Koberda).
Raags, as we'll soon see, are controlled by their combinatorial structure,
which gives us a good way of creating counterexamples by converting algebraic
conditions into combinatorial ones.

Let's start getting to the meat of things: What _is_ a raag?

<div class="boxed" markdown="1">
  Given a (simple, undirected) graph $\Gamma = (V,E)$, the
  <span class="defn">Right Angled Artin Group</span> $A(\Gamma)$ is given by
  the following presentation:

  $$\langle V ~|~ [x,y] \text{ iff } xEy \rangle$$

  (where $[x,y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ is the commutator of $x$ and $y$)
</div>

That is, $A(\Gamma)$ is freely generated by the vertices of $\Gamma$, with
relations saying that two vertices commute if and only if they are joined
by an edge.

âš  Warning: Some people use the opposite convention, and say $x$ and $y$ commute
whenever they _aren't_ joined by an edge in $\Gamma$. Obviously these are
equivalent, by passing to the complement graph, but it's good to know that
this ambiguity exists in the literature. Notably the
[sage package](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/raag.html)
for raags uses the opposite convention.

Of course a definition is no good without examples, so let's give a few
concrete ones:

---

We'll start with $\Gamma = K_3$, the complete graph on $3$ vertices:

![K3](/assets/images/raag-defn/k3.png)

With this graph, we'll have a generator for each vertex $a,b,c$. Moreoever,
since we have an edge conecting each of them, every generator will commute with
every other generator.

Then $A(K_3) = \langle a,b,c ~|~ [a,b],[a,c],[b,c] \rangle$,
which we recognize as $\mathbb{Z}^3$.

---

Next, let's look at the opposite extreme. Let $D_3$ be the discrete graph:

![D3](/assets/images/raag-defn/d3.png)

$A(D_3)$ will still have generators $a$, $b$, and $c$. But now there are _no_
edges, which means there will be no relations between them! Thus
$A(D_3) = \langle a,b,c \rangle \cong F_3$ is the free group on
$3$ generators.

---

Finally, let's look somewhere in between. Let $P_3$ be the path graph with
$3$ vertices:

![P3](/assets/images/raag-defn/p3.png)

Then $A(P_3)$ will be $\langle a,b,c ~|~ [a,b],[a,c] \rangle$. Here
$a$ commutes with $b$ and $c$, since $a$ is adjacent to both of them. However,
$b$ and $c$ don't commute, since they are not adjacent. Notice it's already
less clear if there's a simple description of this group, unlike the previous
two examples. This is a big part of the power of raags: they let us build
complicated groups in a way that we can still understand. The trick is to
think combinatorially instead of algebraically.

As an aside, this is not unlike the automata groups that I worked with in
my undergraduate thesis. In that setting we leveraged the combinatorics of
[Mealy Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine) in order to
understand complicated groups of automorphisms of the infinite binary tree.
Automata groups are _also_ rich sources of counterexamples
(cf. the [grigorchuk group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigorchuk_group))
in group theory for the same reason as raags. In fact, automata groups are
so complicated that we still haven't classified all the groups you can get
from an automaton with only $3$ states! That said,
[a lot of work](https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3555) has been done.

---

Coming back to raags, it is easy to see that $A(D_n) \cong F_n$ and
$A(K_n) \cong \mathbb{Z}^n$ for every $n$. Then adding edges _interpolates_
between free groups and free abelian groups in a way that we can control.
This is not unlike the way the [Lovasz Local Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lov%C3%A1sz_local_lemma)
interpolates between a product bound and a union bound based on the dependency
graph of random variables.

As a quick exercise, what is $A(\Gamma)$ for the square graph shown below?

Raags have lots of nice properties, which you can see outlined in
these articles (and others):
[1](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0610668){% comment %} Charney 2006 {% endcomment %},
[2](http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~jon.mccammond/papers/mysterious-geometry.pdf),
[3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06143){% comment %} expanders {% endcomment %}.
What are these nice properties? Well, as I've been alluding to for a while,
the algebraic structure of $A(\Gamma)$ tends to faithfully capture the
combinatorial structure of $\Gamma$. Here by "capture" I mean that
if $\Gamma$ has some combinatorial property, then $A(\Gamma)$ will always
have some associated algebraic property. By "faithfully" I mean that this is
the _only_ way for $A(\Gamma)$ can have this algebraic property. In other words,
as far as these properties go, $A(\Gamma)$ only does what $\Gamma$ forces it to.
References for each of these examples can be found in link $3$ above:


  - If $\Gamma$ is the disjoint union of $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$,
   then $A(\Gamma) = A(\Gamma_1) \ast A(\Gamma_2)$ is a
   [free product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_product) (do you see why?).
   Moreover, this is the _only_ way $A(\Gamma)$ is able to be a free product:
   If $A(\Gamma) = G \ast H$, then $\Gamma$ is a disjoint union of two graphs,
   and $G$ and $H$ are their corresponding raags.

  - If $\Gamma$ is the [join](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphJoin.html) of
   two graphs $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$, then $A(\Gamma) = A(\Gamma_1) \times A(\Gamma_2)$
   (why?). Again, this is the _only_ way $A(\Gamma)$ can decomopse as a direct product.

  - $\Gamma$ is a tree on $n$ vertices if and only if
     $A(\Gamma)$ is a nontrivial semidirect product of a free-group by $\mathbb{Z}$:
     $A(\Gamma) = F_{n-1} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}$.

  - There is a (more complicated) algebraic condition which happens if and only
   if $\Gamma$ has no full subgraph[^1] equivalent to $P_4$ as above.

[^1]: By a full subgraph I mean if two vertices are adjacent in $\Gamma$ they _must_ be adjacent in the subgraph as well.

  - There is an _extremely_ complicated construction which identifies a
     family of [expander graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph).

You might try to take your own favorite graph-theoretic concepts and see how
they are reflected group-theoretically. Don't be discouraged if you can't show
that your concept is represented faithfully -- many of the above proofs
involve a surprisingly deep toolkit. It's still exciting to see what the
characterization should be. As a more abstract bonus-exercise, here's some
weird food for thought: By analogy to the first two points above, a free
product of _any_ two groups is a kind of generalization of the disjoint
union of two graphs. Similarly, the direct product is a kind of generalization
of the graph-theoretic join.

Now that we understand what a raag _is_, the categorically minded among you
might have a question: Is this a functor? And if so, what can we say about it?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the answer to the first question is "yes". The answer
to the second depends on what category you think our graphs are living in.
I claim there is a most natural choice of category, which I'll describe
in the next post. In the meantime:

<div class="boxed" markdown="1">
  Play around with this functor. What can _you_ say about it? We'll
  compare notes in the next post ^_^
