Banach Spaces are ubiquitous in analysis, and they let us rein in analytic
objects using algebra (in particular, vector spaces) and completeness.
Infinite dimensional vector spaces can be pathological, but by restricting
attention to _continuous_ operations for our topology, we can recover 
analogues for a lot of the finite dimensional theory! 

---

Recall a Banach Space is a vector space equipped with a norm so that
the resulting metric space is [complete][4]. We have already seen some
examples of this, but let's explicitly list some to get a sense of _just_
how common Banach Spaces are!

- $L^p$ spaces, with the $L^p$ norm

    $$\lVert f \rVert_p \triangleq \left ( \int |f|^p \right )^{1/p}$$

- Bounded continuous functions with the $\sup$ norm 

    $$\lVert f \rVert_\infty \triangleq \sup_{x \in X} |fx|$$

  (A particular case is _all_ continuous functions on a compact space[^3])

- Complex valued measures with the [total variation][6] norm[^2]

    $$\lVert \mu \rVert \triangleq |\mu|(X)$$

- $k$-times differentiable functions on $[0,1]$ with the norm

    $$\lVert f \rVert \triangleq \sum_{j=0}^k \left \lVert \frac{d^j}{dx^j} f \right \rVert_\infty$$

- Lipschitz functions on $[0,1]$ with the norm

    $$\lVert f \rVert \triangleq C_f + \lVert f \rVert_\infty$$

  (where $C_f$ is the lipshitz constant for $f$)

- [Sobolev Spaces][8], which I'm told are extremely important.

Of course, we can also build new Banach Spaces from old, and these work in
much the same way as in classical (by which I mean finite dimensional)
linear algebra. 

- If $X$ and $Y$ are banach spaces, then so is $X \times Y$ with the norm

  $$\lVert (x, y) \rVert \triangleq \max \{ \lVert x \rVert, \lVert y \rVert \}$$

  moreover this is the categorical product in $\mathsf{Ban}_1$[^5].

- More generally, if $(X_\alpha)$ is a family of banach spaces, then by 
    $\prod X_\alpha$, we mean 
    $$\{ (x_\alpha) \mid \exists C . \forall \alpha . \lVert x_\alpha \rVert \leq C \}$$.

    We define $\lVert (x_\alpha) \rVert$ to be the least such $C$ 
    (which necessarily equals $\sup \{ \lVert x_\alpha \rVert \}$).
    This is the categorical product in $\mathsf{Ban}_1$, and since one can
    show $\mathsf{Ban}_1$ also has equalizers, we see it is complete.

- If $X$ and $Y$ are banach spaces, then so is $X \oplus Y$ with the norm

    $$\lVert (x,y) \rVert \triangleq \lVert x \rVert + \lVert y \rVert$$

    moreover this is the categorical coproduct in $$\mathsf{Ban}_1$$. 
    Notice, as in the finite dimensional case, that 
    $X \times Y \cong X \oplus Y$, and the difference only becomes relevant
    for _infinite_ products/coproducts[^4].

- More generally, if $(X_\alpha)$ is a family of banach spaces, then by
    $\bigoplus X_\alpha$ we mean 
    $$\{ (x_\alpha) \mid \sum \lVert x_\alpha \rVert \lt \infty \}$$[^6].
    
    Unsurprisingly, we define the norm to be

    $$\lVert (x_\alpha) \rVert \triangleq \sum \lVert x_\alpha \rVert.$$

    Again, this is the categorical coproduct in $\mathsf{Ban}_1$, and since 
    one can show $\mathsf{Ban}_1$ has coequalizers, we see it is cocomplete.

- If $A$ is a _closed_ subspace of $X$, then $A$ is itself a banach space
    with the induced norm[^7]. 

- If $A$ is a _closed_ subspace of $X$, then $X / A$ is a banach space with
    the norm

    $$\lVert x + A \rVert \triangleq \inf_{a \in A} \lVert x + a \rVert$$

    the topology generated by this norm agrees with the quotient topology,
    so we find this does indeed satisfy the universal property of quotients.

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
âš  Short exact sequences of banach spaces do _not_ split in general! 
That is, if $A$ is a closed subspace of $X$, it is _not_ the case that
$X \cong A \oplus (X / A)$! 

See, for instance, [this survey][9] by Mohammad Sal Moslehian[^8].
</div>

- If $X$ and $Y$ are banach spaces, then $\mathcal{L}(X,Y)$, the space
    of continuous linear maps $X \to Y$ is a banach space with the norm[^9]

    $$\lVert T \rVert \triangleq \sup_{\lVert x \rVert = 1} \lVert Tx \rVert$$

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
  As a quick exercise, prove

  $$\lVert Tx \rVert \leq \lVert T \rVert \lVert x \rVert$$

  This is one of the most important inequalities in the subject.
</div>

- As a special case of the previous example, $\mathcal{L}(X,\mathbb{C})$
    is always a banach space. We denote it by $X^*$, the 
    <span class=defn>dual</span> of $X$[^10]. 

---

Now that we have a wide array of examples of banach spaces, we should start
asking how much of our intuition from finite dimensional linear algebra carries
over. After all, a lot of these constructions looked really familiar, but
then we got blindsided by the lack of complements.

Thankfully, there are lots of foundational theorems in banach space theory
which tell us that certain things work exactly as we'd like!




---

Next time, we'll talk about [Hilbert Spaces][3], where we'll require
even more algebraic structure, and thus we'll gain better structure theorems
in exchange.

[^1]:
    In fact, this is analogous to a theorem in [universal algebra][1] --
    Terry Tao talks some about this in one of his [blog posts][2], but it's true
    in very high generality:

    <div class=boxed markdown=1>
      Show that $f : A \to B$ is a homomorphism of algebras if and only if
      its graph is a subalgebra of $A \times B$.
    </div>

[^2]:
    Intuitively this makes sense, but formally it is far from obvious
    (at least to me!). That said, you can find a smattering of proofs
    [here][5]. I'm a fan of the proof by Radon-Nikodym, personally.

[^3]:
    In fact, this accounts for _all_ banach spaces!

    The [Banach-Mazur Representation Theorem][7] says that every banach space
    is isometric to a closed subspace of $C(K)$ for some compact space $K$
    (in fact, the unit ball in the dual with the weak-* topology works).

    In case your banach space is separable, we can do better -- it is a closed
    subspace of $C([0,1])$!

[^4]:
    In fact, in the finite case we can take $\lVert (x,y) \rVert$ to be any of

    - $\max \{ \lVert x \rVert_X, \lVert y \rVert_Y \}$
    - $\sqrt{ \lVert x \rVert_X^2 + \lVert y \rVert_Y^2 }$
    - $\lVert x \rVert_X + \lVert y \rVert_Y$

    and we'll get the same banach space up to isomorphism (but NOT isometry!).

    If you've not seen this before, you should prove it! 
    It's a fairly quick exercise to show these are all equivalent norms,
    and that they are complete.

[^5]:
    The category $\mathsf{Ban}$ of banach spaces with _all_ continuous linear 
    maps turns out to be somewhat badly behaved. 
    But if we restrict to _contracting_ maps, we get a much nicer category,
    $\mathsf{Ban}_1$.

    Notice we can rescale any linear transformation $T$ by a constant to make 
    it a contraction, so this is not really a limitation.

[^6]:
    Notice the coproduct you might expect

    $$\{ (x_\alpha) \mid x_\alpha \neq 0 \text{ for finitely many $\alpha$ } \}$$

    is not complete, and thus not banach (do you see why?). The actual definition
    of the coproduct is exactly the completion of this space in the coproduct
    norm, though.

[^7]:
    Notice we need $A$ to be closed so that it is itself complete.

[^8]:
    In fact, there's more to say! A (nontrivial) theorem says that
    if a banach space satisfies "every closed subspace has a complement" then
    it must actually be a hilbert space! 

    So every non-hilbert banach space must contain a noncomplemented closed subspace!

    See [here][10] (as well as the linked article), for more.

[^9]:
    Recall a linear function is continuous if and only if it is bounded in
    the sense that the norm we're defining is finite.

[^10]:
    In fact, $X^*$ is complete even when $X$ _isn't_. 
    One slick corollary of this is the construction of the completion of 
    a normed space.

    Since $X$ (isometrically!) embeds into its double dual 
    $X \hookrightarrow X^**$, we can define the completion of $X$ to be the 
    closure of $X$ under this embedding.
