This is the sister post to the [main post][1] on the board game clue. 
In this post we give some sage code for analyzing a simpler game that 
my old professor [Adam Bjorndahl][2] used to use to introduce modal logic.
It won't make a ton of sense without the context in the main post,
so I suggest reading it first ^_^.
