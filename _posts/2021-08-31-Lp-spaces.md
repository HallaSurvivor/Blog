On to day $2$ of qual prep boogaloo. <s>Yesterday</s> Tuesday[^13] was all about measures
and integrable functions. Today, then, let's talk about spaces of integrable
functions. It's time for $L^p$ spaces!

Thankfully, this should be a comparatively short post, since $L^p$ spaces
are already pretty concrete, and (at least in my mind) don't need a ton of 
motivation. We want to integrate things, and $L^p$ spaces 
(for $p \lt \infty$) collect the functions which we _can_ integrate. 

The lower values of $p$, such as $p=1$, put emphasis on the _decay_ of a 
function near $\infty$. The benefit we gain is that they place relatively 
little emphasis on singularities.

Conversely, large values of $p$, such as $p=\infty$, put little emphasis on
the decay of a function, but are more sensitive to (potentially mild)
singularities.

As an example, think of $\frac{e^{-x}}{\sqrt{x}}$:

<img src="/assets/images/Lp-spaces/singular.png">

This has a singularity at $0$, but is still in $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ 
because it decays rapidly. This function is _not_ in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$
(and _certainly_ not in $L^\infty$), because its singularity is too sharp. 

Conversely, consider the constant $1$ function, shown here for completeness
more than anything else:

<img src="/assets/images/Lp-spaces/bounded.png">

This function doesn't decay _at all_, so is certainly not $L^1$. 
It turns out this function is _only_ $L^\infty$, which doesn't care at
all about decay. It only cares about boundedness.

A less silly example might be $\chi_{[1,\infty)} \frac{1}{x}$:

<img src="/assets/images/Lp-spaces/bounded2.png">

This function decays too slowly to be $L^1$, but it _does_ decay quickly
enough to be $L^2$.

The most important cases are $L^1$, $L^2$, and $L^\infty$,
but [there are reasons][1] to care about other choices of $p$ as well. 
Psychologically, they let us interpolate between how much singularity we
want to allow, versus how slowly we want to allow our functions to decay.

---

To start, let's remind ourselves what $L^p$ spaces even _are_. We fix a set
$X$ with a measure $\mu$. Then (for $1 \leq p \lt \infty$), we define the
$p$-norm to be

$$\lVert f \rVert_p \triangleq \left ( \int |f|^p \ d \mu \right )^{1/p}$$

As is often the case, we need to treat $L^\infty$ specially. We write[^14]

$$
\lVert f \rVert_\infty \triangleq \inf \Big \{ M \ \Big | \ |f| \leq M \text{ a.e.} \Big \}
$$

Now we can define (for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$)

$$
L^p(X, \mu) \triangleq
\bigg \{
  f : X \to \mathbb{C} \ \bigg | \lVert f \rVert_p \lt \infty
\bigg \}
$$

As usual, we will consider two functions the same if they agree
almost everywhere. We will also often write $L^p(X)$, $L^p(\mu)$, or even
$L^p$ if the measure or space is clear from context.

It turns out $L^p(\mu)$ comes equipped with a _ton_ of structure!
The norm $\lVert f \rVert_p$ really _is_ a norm[^1],
and this norm makes $L^p(\mu)$ into a [banach space][2] 
(so we can talk about convergence without worry[^2]). 

Let's see some important examples of $L^p$ spaces before we move on:

1. If $m$ is the lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n, m)$ is 
one of the most common examples used in practice. This forms the basis
for a lot of intuition about $L^p$ spaces.

2. Sometimes $\mathbb{R}^n$ is too big. We might think of working
with $L^p([a,b])$. Common choices are $[0,1]$ and $[0,2\pi]$.

3. Another important example is the circle $S^1$. The space
$L^2(S^1)$ is the archetypal first example for fourier theory[^4].

4. An example in a different vein is $L^p(\mathbb{N})$ with the counting measure.
This is often called $\ell^p$. Here our functions can be thought of as 
sequences of complex numbers, which makes this a particularly appealing 
setting for small examples. We'll find $\ell^2$ extremely useful when we
talk about [hilbert spaces][3].

5. The counterpoint to example (3) is $L^p(\mathbb{Z})$, again with the
counting measure. These are bi-infinite sequences of complex numbers,
often written $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$, and these will be related to functions
on the circle by means of the fourier transform.

One of the most important tools we have for proving properties about $L^p$ 
functions is the wide variety of dense subsets. If we want to prove something
for all $L^p$ functions, we can start out by proving that thing for some 
subclass where we have more available tools, then argue by continuity that 
the result is actually true for all $L^p$ functions.

These sets of functions are dense in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $L^p([0,1])$,
where $p \neq \infty$. More generally, they are true in $L^p(X,\mu)$
for radon measures on locally compact hausdorff spaces. See Rudin's
_Real and Complex Analysis_ for more details.

* Simple Functions (with finite-measure support). 
That is, functions of the form $$\sum_{k=1}^n c_k \chi_{E_k}$$. 
These are dense almost by definition[^3] and form the base for proving other,
more exiting density results. After all, to show a class of functions is dense
in $L^p$, it suffices to show it can approximate the simple functions.
If we allow infinite measure support, then these functions are dense in
$L^\infty$ as well.

* Continuous Functions (with compact support). 
Obviously these are great. We don't always need the
extra power of compact support, but it's good to know it's there!

These families of dense functions require a notion of differentiation. 
They're definitely true in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $[0,1]$, and I suspect they're
true over any manifold. I don't have a reference on hand, though.

* Smooth Functions (with compact support).
We love differentiation in this household. 

* [Schwarz Functions][3].
As long as we're discussing things that only work in $\mathbb{R}^n$, 
these are functions which are not only smooth, but which vanish more quickly
than any polynomial, and all their derivatives vanish that quickly too.
We'll talk more about these in the post about fourier theory.

These families of functions also require some compactness condition
(because we're using the [stone-weierstrass theorem][4]).

* Polynomials.
On $[0,1]$, we can approximate by polynomials

* Polynomials in $e^{ix}$. 
On $S^1$, we can approximate by "trigonometric polynomials". This will be
extremely important when we start talking about fourier theory.

There's actually a kind of master theorem for density results in $L^p$ 
spaces ($p \neq \infty$), which takes some basic properties of a class of 
functions and tells you it's dense. There are also generalizations of the
theorems above to much more broad classes of measure spaces. For each of these
results, see [this][5] pdf from Bruce Driver's UCSD lecture notes.

Before we move on, these density results are one potential source of 
motivation for $L^1$.
We're obviously interested in continuous functions, and if we want to
integrate things, the $L^1$ norm seems like a fairly reasonable metric to
look at. The issue is that $L^1$ limits of continuous functions don't need 
to be continuous! That is, $CX$ is _not_ complete with respect to the 
$L^1$ norm. We like to know we can take limits with reckless abandon[^10],
so we should take its completion. When we do this, we get exactly the
$L^1$ functions. 

This is one reason that $L^\infty$ behaves "pathologically" compared to
the other $L^p$ spaces. When you take the completion of continuous functions
with compact support in the $p$-norm for $p \lt \infty$, get get exactly $L^p$. 
_However_, when you take the completion in the $\infty$-norm, you get 
the functions [vanishing at $\infty$][20]. You might try to solve this by
looking at the bounded continuous functions, rather than those of compact
support[^11], but these _already_ form a banach space! It seems that,
unavoidably, $L^\infty$ has a bunch of extra stuff in it, and it's this
extra stuff that is responsible for many of the differences between
$L^\infty$ and the other $L^p$ spaces.

Perhaps the most important inequality associated with $L^p$ spaces is 
[Hölder's inequality][6], which generalizes the [Cauchy-Schwarz][7] inequality.

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
If $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$, then

$$\lVert fg \rVert_1 \leq \lVert f \rVert_p \lVert g \rVert_q.$$

This includes the formal case where $\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{\infty} = 1$:

$$\lVert fg \rVert_1 \leq \lVert f \rVert_1 \lVert g \rVert_\infty.$$

This condition on $p$ and $q$ shows up frequently, and we call $q$ the
<span class=defn>conjugate</span> of $p$ for convenience.
</div>

Here we might think of $g$ as defining a functional $\phi_g$, where
$\phi_g f \triangleq \int f g$. Then Hölder's inequality says that
(with the operator norm) $\lVert \phi_g \rVert \leq \lVert g \rVert_q$.

From this, one might ask if we actually have equality above. If you're feeling
particularly optimistic, you might even wonder if we can characterize which
functionals in $(L^p)^*$ arise as $\phi_g$ for some $g \in L^q$.

Now for the magic part:

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
For $p \neq 1, \infty$ the dual space
$$(L^p)^* \triangleq \{ T : L^p \to \mathbb{C} \mid T \text{ is continuous and linear} \}$$
has an explicit characterization:

$$(L^p)^* \cong L^q$$

where $q$ is the conjugate of $p$.

When $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite[^5], we moreover have $(L^1)^* \cong L^\infty$.
Unfortunately, though, $(L^\infty)^*$ is almost never $L^1$ 
(at least, assuming the axiom of choice[^6]).
</div>

The proof of this fact actually goes through complex valued measures!
If $\phi$ is a functional on $L^p$, then it's not hard to see that 
$\nu E \triangleq \phi \chi_E$ is a (complex valued) measure! Moreover,
if $E$ is $\mu$-null, then $\chi_E = 0$ a.e., and so 
$\nu E = \phi \chi_E = 0$. This means $\nu \ll \mu$, and so by radon-nikodym
$\nu = \mu_g$ for some function $g$. Now some simple bookkeeping is all we
need to do to show that $g \in L^q$ and $\phi f = \int fg$.

Notice this means that for $1 \lt p \lt \infty$ we have 

$$
(L^p)^{**} = (L^q)^* = L^p
$$

so $L^p$ is [reflexive][12]. It's still not entirely obvious to me why 
reflexive spaces are as interesting as they are. It's obviously a natural
question (and a fairly algebraic one[^7]), and it gives you quite a bit of
bonus information (see [here][13], for instance). I suspect that I'll come to
appreciate it more as I do more functional analysis[^8]. At the very least,
it's nice to have a full characterization of the dual space, and it's 
satisfying to get back where you started when you dualize twice.

---

Frequently one has a function $f \in L^p$, which we would _like_ to know 
is in $L^q$. More generally, we would like to relate functions in $L^p$
to functions in $L^q$ with $q$ on either side of $p$.

For instance, when doing fourier analysis, our hilbert space techniques only
work for $L^2(S^1)$ functions, which get mapped by the fourier transform
isometrically onto $\ell^2(\mathbb Z)$. However, we can show that 
$\ell^1(\mathbb Z) \subseteq \ell^2(\mathbb Z)$, and thus we see that if
$f$ is $L^1(S^1)$ and $\hat{f}$ is $\ell^1(\mathbb Z)$, then the results
(which we'll talk about soon) still hold.

With that said, here are the main theorems for useful inclusions:

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
If $X$ has finite measure, then _going down_ is allowed. 
That is, if $q \geq p$, then every $L^q$ function is automatically $L^p$.

Formally, if $q \geq p$, then $L^q \subseteq L^p$. 

(As an easy exercise, you should prove this)
</div>

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
If $X$ is "discrete" in the sense that it does not have sets of arbitrarily
small measure, then _going up_ is allowed. 
That is, if $p \leq q$, then every $L^p$ function is automatically $L^q$.

Formally, if $p \leq q$, then $L^p \subseteq L^q$.

(Again, this is a fairly easy exercise)
</div>

In fact, both of the above statements are equivalences. 
So going down is allowed _if and only if_ $X$ has finite measure,
and going up is allowed _if and only if_ $X$ has subsets of minimal measure[^15].

Notice how these line up with the singularity/rapid decay tradeoff we 
mentioned earlier. If $X$ has finite measure, then 
(intuitively) there's no "infinity" to worry about decaying towards. 
So the decay penalization is irrelevant, and we get an inclusion of
"lower singularity" functions into "higher singularity" functions with
no further qualifications[^12].

Conversely, if there are sets of minimal measure, then (intuitively)
_any_ singularity on one of your atoms can't be avoided, and we get the
inclusion of "rapidly decaying" functions into "slowly decaying" functions
with no further qualifications[^16].

Of course, once we know that, say $L^2([0,1]) \subseteq L^1([0,1])$, it's natural
to ask "how many $L^1$ functions are actually $L^2$?". 
The answer is "almost none"!

It turns out that $L^2([0,1])$ is [meagre][15] in $L^1([0,1])$. This is a 
topological notion of "smallness" which is roughly akin to being a nullset[^9].
This is a cute application of the [baire category theorem][18], which is
the topic of an upcoming blog post.

We also have _interpolation_ functions which, if $p \lt q \lt r$,
lets us relate $L^q$ functions to those on either side.

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
If $p \lt q \lt r \lt \infty$, then $L^q \subseteq L^p + L^r$.

That is, every $L^q$ function can be written as a sum of an $L^p$ function
and an $L^r$ function. 
</div>

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
If $p \lt q \lt r \lt \infty$, then $L^p \cap L^r \subseteq L^q$.

That is, the $L^p$ classes are "connected". If you're $L^p$ and you're 
$L^r$, then you're automatically everywhere in between as well.

In fact, we have the bound 

$$
\lVert f \rVert_q \leq \lVert f \rVert_p^\lambda \lVert f \rVert_r^{(1 - \lambda)}
$$

for $\lambda = \frac{q^{-1} - r^{-1}}{p^{-1} - r^{-1}}$.
</div>

Alright, that was another huge information dump! This post felt less like a
motivated tour through $L^p$ functions and more like a copy of a study guide,
haha. I think that's reasonable, though, since in my experience $L^p$ functions
are pretty motivated by themselves. I'm mainly writing this so that when I
talk about Banach spaces soon we'll have all these examples to draw from.
Plus, selfishly, it _was_ nice to organize all this information while
planning out this post. 

I've learned from my mistakes, and I'm not going to try and give a concrete
date for the next post. All I'll say is: See you soon ^_^

[^1]:
    This is one pressing reason to quotient by almost-everywhere equivalence.
    Do you see why $\lVert f \rVert_p$ would _not_ be a norm if we didn't 
    identify equivalent functions? 

    One reasonable question might be whether we can always find a canonical
    representative for a given equivalence class modulo nullsets. That is,
    given a "function" in $L^p$ (which is really an equivalence class of functions)
    can we select an honest-to-goodness function from each class? Obviously 
    the axiom of choice trivializes this, but we would like to do so in a way
    that's actually implementable. 

    This is an extremely interesting question, and is the fundamental question
    in [lifting theory][21].

[^2]:
    Don't worry -- we'll be talking a _lot_ about banach spaces in an upcoming 
    post. But $L^p$ spaces are very fundamental examples, so it's worth talking
    about them first.

[^3]:
    Recall we _define_ the lebesgue integral of $f$ 
    to be the limit of the integrals of simple functions below $f$.

[^4]:
    We'll talk about Fourier theory in an upcoming post too!

[^5]:
    Actually, we can get by with slightly less.

    We always have a natural map $L^\infty \to (L^1)^*$ which sends
    $g$ to the functional $f \mapsto \int fg$.

    It turns out this map is an isometric embedding if and only if $\mu$
    is semifinite. That is, when any infinite measure set contains a set of
    finite measure. This is obviously a _super_ mild assumption.

    Moreover, this map is _surjective_ (and thus an isometry) when $\mu$
    is "localizable". See [here][8], for instance.

[^6]:
    $L^1$ embeds isometrically inside $(L^\infty)^*$, but in $\mathsf{ZFC}$
    this is _not_ surjective. 
    
    To build a functional on $L^\infty$ that doesn't come from some $L^1$
    function, we look at the subspace of continuous functions, and 
    consider evaluation at a point. We can extend this functional to the 
    whole space via the [Hahn-Banach Theorem][9], and it's pretty quick to
    see that this can't come from an $L^1$ function 
    (since a dirac delta function doesn't _really_ exist).

    We'll talk more about the Hahn-Banach theorem in a future post, but
    importantly it relies on the axiom of choice! There are actually models
    of set theory where Hahn-Banach fails, and which think that 
    $L^1$ really _is_ $(L^\infty)^*$! See Martin Väth's 
    [_The Dual Space of $L^\infty$ is $L^1$_][10], as well as the excellent
    discussion [here][11]

[^7]:
    The question of which $R$-modules are reflexive has also been asked.
    It's a more subtle question, but finitely generated projective modules
    always have this property.

    As an aside that I can't help but mention, apparently there is a banach
    space which is isomorphic to its double dual, but for which the canonical
    evaluation map is _not_ the isomorphism! It's called [James's Space][14],
    for the interested.


[^8]:
    For instance, an integral that takes values in a banach space might not 
    satisfy the radon-nikodym theorem. If your banach space is reflexive, though,
    then it _does_. This came from the linked mse question, so I might be 
    misquoting the result or dropping some hypotheses, but this already makes
    the notion of reflexivity seem more interesting.

[^9]:
    In the sense that meagre sets and nullsets both form [$\sigma$-ideals][16].
    Note, however, that they are _very_ different notions of "small", and 
    a set which is small in one sense need not be small in the other.

    For instance, [fat cantor sets][17] can have arbitrarily large measure
    (in particular, they are _not_ null) yet they are always meagre.

[^10]:
    This is in line with an apocryphal quote of Grothendieck
    (which is probably [not actually his][19]) that it's better to have
    _good_ categories with _bad_ objects, than _bad_ categories with _good_
    objects. 

    That is, we want our categories to have all limits, colimits, exponentials, etc.
    even if it means introducing "pathological" objects. It's easier to know you
    can take limits and worry about what the result looks like later than it is
    to constantly worry about whether you can take the limit at all.

    Similarly, from an analytic lens, it's better to have a _complete_ space
    (which admits potentially ugly functions) than it is to have an 
    _incomplete_ space in which every function is nice.

[^11]:
    You need boundedness in order to guarantee that the sup norm
    $\lVert \cdot \rVert_\infty$ is finitely valued.

[^12]:
    This may require some meditation. 

    The idea is that we don't care if a function is singular as long as the 
    infinity can be contained to a set of small enough measure. 
    But if there _are_ no sets of "small enough" measure, then _any_ singularity
    is bad.

[^13]:
    I've been busier than expected... So much for one post a day, haha.

[^14]:
    The notation comes from a (non-obvious) theorem that 

    $$
    \lVert f \rVert_\infty = \lim_{p \to \infty} \lVert f \rVert_p.
    $$

    See [here][22] for a proof.

[^15]:
    For proofs of these exercises, and indeed proofs of the stronger equivalences,
    see [here][23]

[^16]:
    In the motivational section before this, we mention that 
    $\ell^1(\mathbb Z) \subseteq \ell^2(\mathbb Z)$. Now we see why: $\mathbb{Z}$
    has no (nonnull) sets of measure $\lt 1$.
