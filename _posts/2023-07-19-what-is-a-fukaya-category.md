title: What the Hell is a Fukaya Category?

Interesting for physicists and symplectic geometers 
(TODO: link some stuff on mirror symmetry) but I'm woefully 
underqualified to talk about any of that stuff.

Let's talk about what it _is_, then I'll pick a _different_ 
motivating problem that's a bit closer to earth.

It's a "category" whose objects are curves in your surface, 
and where you have a chain complex worth of arrows between 
any two curves.

TODO: Link the floer homology or whatever it's called, mention in a footnote
that it's like morse homology.

Why would you want to do this? Motivate via intersection numbers of curves.
This categorifies the intersection numbers, which can reveal structure 
that we wouldn't otherwise see.

Now, why was "category" in scare quotes? Well because composition 
_isn't associative_! It's not the case that $(fg)h = f(gh)$. But we 
have the next best thing. There's a homotopy $H : (fg)h \sim f(gh)$.

Now mention how to compose four arrows. There's multple homotopies involved...
But there's a higher homotopy showing they're the same!

Should I split off a "What is an $A_\infty$-algebra" into a separate post? 
Maybe...
