title: What the Hell is a Fukaya Category?
tags:

The [Fukaya Category][1] of a surface is a deep and interesting invariant 
with important applications to physics (in particular, to [Mirror Symmetry][2]).
They've recently shown up in my research, which is exciting and scary in 
equal measure. The definition is already pretty intimidating, and if you 
try to look up motivation and examples, you'll be met with a deluge of terms 
like "$A_\infty$ Structure", "Maslov Index", and "Novikov Field". Even just 
trying to understand the chain complex structure requires knowledge of 
(compactifications of) moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic disks in your surface! 
It's unbelievable to me that anyone could have come up with this, or worse, 
that anyone could calculate anything to do with it! With this in mind, 
I wanted to find a different (more mathematical) motivation for the fukaya 
category, which made it feel more natural (at least to me).
Earlier this year I co-organized a reading group on symplectic geometry 
and fukaya categories with [Catherine Cannizzo][3], and I got to organize 
my thoughts into a talk. Now, _months_ later, I'm finally writing up a blog 
post about them. I hope this is as helpful for other people as it was for me!
