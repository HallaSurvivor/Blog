title: In Which I Think Too Hard About Clue (Modal Logic and Epistemic Game Theory)
tags:

Over New Years, I played a few games of [clue][1] with some friends while
I was upstate. This was my first time playing since I was a little kid,
and we all had a great time, but I couldn't help but think about what 
perfect play would look like. After all, one of the two big aspects of the 
game is keeping track of all the information which is revealed by the guesses
paeople make. This problem is perfectly suited for study by [modal logic][2],
and in fact my old professor [Adam Bjorndahl][3] used a simpler game of 
perfect information in order to introduce us all to the topic!

I've been thinking about clue for the past couple weeks now[^1], and ideally 
I would put it to bed before the end of January. I think I'm pretty close,
and want to write up this blog post to share my thoughts so far. Plus, I've
enlisted a probabilist friend ([Rahul Rajkumar][4]) to help me 
finish the problem, and I promised him a writeup of exactly what's left to do.
Since I was writing something up _anyways_, it makes sense to just put it 
on the blog for everyone!

So then, let's get started ^_^

---

Let's start with the simple problem that Adam gave us all those years ago.
Say that you have 3 people in a room, each wearing either a red or blue hat[^2].

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/red-hat.gif" width="33%">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/blue-hat.gif" width="33%">
</p>

Each player can see the other two hats, but no player can see their own hat.
At the start of the game, an arbiter walks in and says 
"at least one of you is wearing a red hat!". At this point play begins,
with players taking turns either announcing whether they know their own 
hat color. The game ends once somebody _does_ figure out their hat color.

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
The obvious question posed is whether this "game" ever ends, or whether 
our three hat-wearers will be forced to take turns saying that they 
don't know for eternity.

It's worth thinking about this for yourself before reading on!
</div>

Clearly we wouldn't be talking about this if the game never ended, so 
let's try to figure out where the information about hat color is coming from.

As a test case, let's imagine a world where player 1 has a red hat, and 
players 2 and 3 have blue hats.

Since the arbiter said there's at least one red hat, and player 1 sees two 
blue hats, it's easy to deduce that her hat must be the red one, and the game ends.

Now, as another example, let's consider a world where players 1 and 2 have 
red hats, and player 3 has a blue hat. Again, we start with player 1, but now
player 1 sees a red hat. So she can't immediately know her hat color, and she
announces that. Next comes player 2, and a slightly trickier piece of logic.
He knows that, if his hat were blue, then player 1 would see two blue hats,
and would have known her hat color. So the fact that player 1 _didn't_ 
know her hat color means player 2 knows his hat can't be blue. Thus it's red,
and he announces he knows his hat color!

So now we see the miracle: by announcing that she _doesn't_ know her hat
color, player 1 has actually added information into the system, which
player 2 can use to deduce his hat color! You might imagine that on 
every round more information is added to the system until somebody 
_must_ know their hat color.

Is there a way to make this idea more precise, so that we can 
apply it to this and similar problems[^3] in a more standardized way?

Again the answer is "yes", and we'll use the machinery of [modal logic][2]
(in particular [epistemic logic][8]) to analyze these kinds of games!

---

The key idea is to keep track of all the "possible worlds". As more 
information is added, certain worlds are no longer possible, and we delete
them. If we start with finitely many worlds, and we show that the number of
worlds goes down on each round, then we're guaranteed the game will stop! 

Moreover, we keep track of which worlds are indistinguishable for each player.
For instance, in the hats game, player 1 can't tell the difference between
two worlds where she sees the same hat. For example, 
(Red,Red,Blue) and (Blue,Red,Blue) look the same to her, since in both 
of these worlds she sees player 2 with a red hat and player 3 with a blue hat.

We can package this data into a (labelled, multi)graph 
(which in this context is called a [kripke frame][9]) whose vertices are 
possible worlds. We add an edge labelled $i$ between two worlds exactly
when player $i$ can't distinguish between them.

So, for the hats game, we have 8 possible worlds corresponding to the 
8 ways of assigning the hats. The relevant kripke frame looks like this[^4]:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/cube.png" width="50%">
</p>

But when the arbiter comes in and announces that at least one player has a 
red hat, it becomes <span class=defn>Common Knowledge</span> that $BBB$
is not actually a possible world. So we delete it from our frame, and 
we're left with a new graph:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/cube-1.png" width="50%">
</p>

Now, if the "real world" has no $i$-edges, then player $i$ knows it's the
real world (because they have no ambiguity). So player $i$ passes, it means
they _don't_ know what the real world is, so we can delete any $i$-isolated
vertices (vertices who have no incident $i$-labeled edges).

So from here, if $RBB$ is the real world, then player 1 would announce that
she knows her hat color and the game would end in 1 turn.

If $RBB$ is not the real world, then player 1 announces she does not know her
hat color, and the game goes on. But her announcement makes it common knowledge
that $RBB$ is not the real world, and we update the kripke frame accordingly:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/cube-2.png" width="50%">
</p>

Now it's player 2's turn. If either $RRB$ or $BRB$ is real, then player 2 
knows his hat color (since both of these vertices are 2-isolated, meaning
player 2 has no uncertainty as to what the real world is) and the game 
ends in 2 turns.

If neither of these are real, then player 2 announces he does not know his 
hat color, and the game goes on. Again, it becomes common knowledge that 
$RRB$ and $BRB$ are not the real world, so they get deleted from the kripke
frame:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/cube-3.png" width="50%">
</p>

Of course, in this kripke frame, there _are no 3-edges_! So no matter
which world is real, player 3 knows the real world and announces this.
So in any of these worlds, the game ends in 3 turns.

<br><br>

Notice, by doing this analysis, we are able to compute some interesting 
invariants of our game. For instance, the longest possible game lasts 3 turns,
and the "average" game (assuming each of the 7 possible real worlds occurs
with probability $\frac{1}{7}$) lasts $\frac{17}{7} \approx 2.42$ turns.

We can also answer some other interesting questions about the game. For instance:

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
Is it always the case that, after the game is over, everybody knows their 
hat color?
</div>

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
What is the maximum game length with 4 players? What is the expected game length?
What about for $n$ players?
</div>

You should really try this exercise yourself, and this 
might include programming a simulation of the game in order 
to get data for conjectures[^5]. 
In case you want to skip the programming and get straight to
the data gathering, I've uploaded my old sage file in a sister
blog post [here][11]. It's been a bit since we've had some 
good inline sage code for experimentation[^7]!

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p>

Ok. Now we've worked out the toy example, let's get back to business[^6].
Clue.

The basic premise of clue is to figure out the details of a murder. 
There's three kinds of card: Weapons, Rooms, and Suspects. 

Before the game starts, one weapon, room and suspect are chosen at random
and put into an envelope -- these represent the "how/where/who" of the murder.
Then the remaining cards are distributed among the players, who take turns
guessing what they _think_ is in the envelope.

After player $k$ makes a guess, player $k+1$ either announces that she
can falsify the guess (by showing player $k$ one of the guessed cards in her hand)
or that she can't. If she can't, then player $k+2$ makes the same announcement
until either someone can falsify the guess or we get back to player $k$.

Now, there's one thing that makes clue more complicated than the hat game
from the previous section[^8]. On each turn, players make _choices_! 
The player guessing gets to _choose_ which guess to make. Moreover, if a player
happens to be holding multiple cards which falsify a guess, she can _choose_
which card to reveal to the player who guessed!

Trying to determine which choices a player should make in a given situation
is extremely interesting. It also seems extremely hard, and with my paltry
knowledge of game theory I'm not sure how to tackle it... 

Following the wise advice of Pólya, then, let's find an easier problem we 
_can_ solve[^9]. We'll remove the choice in which card to show by requiring
a player prioritize showing Weapons before Rooms before Suspects if they
have multiple cards falsifying a guess. Then, we'll remove the choice of
which guess to make by having each player guess uniformly randomly[^10].

Then, by analyzing the kripke frame, we'll be able to figure out 
(under the assumptions that everyone is playing perfectly, and 
everyone knows everyone is playing perfectly) the
hypothetical quickest win, the hypothetical _slowest_ win, and
the expected length of a game. Just like we did for the hat game!

<br><br>

There's one last hang up to handle, though. 

In the hats problem, every announcement immediately becomes _common knowledge_
in the sense that every player knows about the announcement. In clue,
when player $k$ makes a guess and player $k+i$ _can't_ falsify it, then 
it becomes common knowledge that player $k+i$ doesn't have any of the
guessed cards in their hand.

_However_, when player $k+i$ announces they _can_ falsify the guess, 
it becomes common knowledge that she's holding at least one of the guessed 
cards... But only player $k$ learns which one!

People in the know call this a <span class=defn>Semi-Private</span> 
Announcement, since the details of the announcement are conveyed only to
player $k$, but it's common knowledge that an announcement was made.

It's not obvious how to update the kripke frame in this case, but 
some deep thought[^11] shows that the right thing to do is delete
any $k$-edges connecting worlds which player $k$ can now distinguish.
Said another way, it becomes common knowledge that player $k$ can distinguish
between worlds where she was shown, say, a weapon vs a room[^12], so we can
safely delete the edge indicating player $k$'s ambiguity in that situation.

[^2]:
    I have no idea what these gifs are from, unfortunately. I found them
    on giphy ([red][6] and [blue][7]) by searching "blue hat" and looking 
    for a collection that had both blue and red hats...

    I thought it was from a music video at first 
    (and if it is, it's one I'd love to see), but it seems like it's 
    owned by a modeling company "Lindsey L33". 

    Either way, they're fun for the post, haha.

[^3]:
    Like clue 🤔

[^4]:
    Really each vertex should have a self loop of each label, since every
    player thinks a world is indistinguishable from itself. 

    This comes up in more complex analyses, but we're going to ignore it
    here because they clutter the graph.

    In case you want to skip most of the experimentation/conjecture phase as 
    well, I'll just leave this here: [A000337][12]

    <!--
      So, we can actually say a bit more. It looks like on round i 
      we have 2^{i-1} many i-isolated vertices. Do you see why? 

      We start with a single 1-isolated vertex, and every vertex is 
      i-connected to exactly one other vertex (unless it's been deleted),
      can you use this to show inductively that on round i we have 2^{i-1}
      i-isolated vertices?

      I thought about putting this in the post, but then decided it's too big
      a hint, so... comment. 
    -->

[^8]:
    Really two things: 
    Clue has a game board, and each player gets a token.
    The players have to roll dice to move their token around the board, 
    and can only make guesses when their token is located in a room. 
    Moreover, they can only make a guess regarding the room they're in!

    We are completely ignoring this facet of the game, as it's not related to
    the exchange of information between players, which is what I find most
    interesting.

[^9]:
    At least, in wise words often attributed to him, haha. See [here][13].

[^10]:
    I'm writing a clue simulator as part of this project, and I have pipe
    dreams of implementing other potential strategies, but we'll see if
    I ever get to it. I would love to run a little simulation of how
    strategies fare against each other in the style of [Primer][14]
    or [Nicky Case][15].

    As usual, everything will be open source, and if _you_ decide to 
    play around with other strategies, definitely let me know!

[^11]:
    Deep though which resulted in something obvious in hindsight, 
    as is the way of these things

[^12]:
    This is why we made it deterministic which card gets shown if
    there's multiple options, 
    by prioritizing Weapons over Rooms over Suspects.

    With this rule in place it becomes common knowledge what the player
    revealing their hand _must_ have revealed in any world, which enables
    every player to simultaneously update their viewpoint.

    If we allow players to reveal whichever card they like, then we bifurcate
    into _more_ worlds. One world for each card a player could have revealed.
    This would mean that occasionally our number of worlds _increases_, 
    which makes the analysis more complicated than it already is... Better to
    stay simple in the interest of actually finishing the project!

    This is not to say we _couldn't_ model this! -- the key buzzword is 
    "Action Model", see chapter 6 of van Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, and Kooi's 
    _Dynamic Epistemic Logic_ for more.

    This post is pretty light on the actual _logic_ part of modal logic,
    since we're focusing on the combinatorial aspects. I would love to 
    write up a post talking more about the underlying logical aspects
    of what's happening, but it seems unnecessary when such good books are 
    available!
