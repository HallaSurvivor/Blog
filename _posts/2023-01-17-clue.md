title: In Which I Think Too Hard About Clue (Modal Logic and Epistemic Game Theory)

Over New Years, I played a few games of [clue][1] with some friends while
I was upstate. This was my first time playing since I was a little kid,
and we all had a great time, but I couldn't help but think about what 
perfect play would look like. After all, one of the two big aspects of the 
game is keeping track of all the information which is revealed by the guesses
paeople make. This problem is perfectly suited for study by [modal logic][2],
and in fact my old professor [Adam Bjorndahl][3] used a simpler game of 
perfect information in order to introduce us all to the topic!

I've been thinking about clue for the past couple weeks now[^1], and ideally 
I would put it to bed before the end of January. I think I'm pretty close,
and want to write up this blog post to share my thoughts so far. Plus, I've
enlisted a probabilist friend ([Rahul Rajkumar][4]) to help me 
finish the problem, and I promised him a writeup of exactly what's left to do.
Since I was writing something up _anyways_, it makes sense to just put it 
on the blog for everyone!

So then, let's get started ^_^

---

Let's start with the simple problem that Adam gave us all those years ago.
Say that you have 3 people in a room, each wearing either a red or blue hat[^2].

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/red-hat.gif" width="33%">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/blue-hat.gif" width="33%">
</p>

Each player can see the other two hats, but no player can see their own hat.
At the start of the game, an arbiter walks in and says 
"at least one of you is wearing a red hat!". At this point play begins,
with players taking turns either announcing whether they know their own 
hat color. The game ends once somebody _does_ figure out their hat color.

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
The obvious question posed is whether this "game" ever ends, or whether 
our three hat-wearers will be forced to take turns saying that they 
don't know for eternity.

It's worth thinking about this for yourself before reading on!
</div>

Clearly we wouldn't be talking about this if the game never ended, so 
let's try to figure out where the information about hat color is coming from.

As a test case, let's imagine a world where player 1 has a red hat, and 
players 2 and 3 have blue hats.

Since the arbiter said there's at least one red hat, and player 1 sees two 
blue hats, it's easy to deduce that her hat must be the red one, and the game ends.

Now, as another example, let's consider a world where players 1 and 2 have 
red hats, and player 3 has a blue hat. Again, we start with player 1, but now
player 1 sees a red hat. So she can't immediately know her hat color, and she
announces that. Next comes player 2, and a slightly trickier piece of logic.
He knows that, if his hat were blue, then player 1 would see two blue hats,
and would have known her hat color. So the fact that player 1 _didn't_ 
know her hat color means player 2 knows his hat can't be blue. Thus it's red,
and he announces he knows his hat color!

So now we see the miracle: by announcing that she _doesn't_ know her hat
color, player 1 has actually added information into the system, which
player 2 can use to deduce his hat color! You might imagine that on 
every round more information is added to the system until somebody 
_must_ know their hat color.

Is there a way to make this idea more precise, so that we can 
apply it to this and similar problems[^3] in a more standardized way?

Again the answer is "yes", and we'll use the machinery of [modal logic][2]
(in particular [epistemic logic][8]) to analyze these kinds of games!

---

The key idea is to keep track of all the "possible worlds". As more 
information is added, certain worlds are no longer possible, and we delete
them. If we start with finitely many worlds, and we show that the number of
worlds goes down on each round, then we're guaranteed the game will stop! 

Moreover, we keep track of which worlds are indistinguishable for each player.
For instance, in the hats game, player 1 can't tell the difference between
two worlds where she sees the same hat. For example, 
(Red,Red,Blue) and (Blue,Red,Blue) look the same to her, since in both 
of these worlds she sees player 2 with a red hat and player 3 with a blue hat.

We can package this data into a (labelled, multi)graph 
(which in this context is called a [kripke frame][9]) whose vertices are 
possible worlds. We add an edge labelled $i$ between two worlds exactly
when player $i$ can't distinguish between them.

So, for the hats game, we have 8 possible worlds corresponding to the 
8 ways of assigning the hats. The relevant kripke frame looks like this[^4]:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/cube.png" width="50%">
</p>

But when the arbiter comes in and announces that at least one player has a 
red hat, it becomes <span class=defn>Common Knowledge</span> that $BBB$
is not actually a possible world. So we delete it from our frame, and 
we're left with a new graph:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/cube-1.png" width="50%">
</p>

Now, if the "real world" has no $i$-edges, then player $i$ knows it's the
real world (because they have no ambiguity). So player $i$ passes, it means
they _don't_ know what the real world is, so we can delete any $i$-isolated
vertices (vertices who have no incident $i$-labeled edges).

So from here, if $RBB$ is the real world, then player 1 would announce that
she knows her hat color and the game would end in 1 turn.

If $RBB$ is not the real world, then player 1 announces she does not know her
hat color, and the game goes on. But her announcement makes it common knowledge
that $RBB$ is not the real world, and we update the kripke frame accordingly:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/cube-2.png" width="50%">
</p>

Now it's player 2's turn. If either $RRB$ or $BRB$ is real, then player 2 
knows his hat color (since both of these vertices are 2-isolated, meaning
player 2 has no uncertainty as to what the real world is) and the game 
ends in 2 turns.

If neither of these are real, then player 2 announces he does not know his 
hat color, and the game goes on. Again, it becomes common knowledge that 
$RRB$ and $BRB$ are not the real world, so they get deleted from the kripke
frame:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/clue/cube-3.png" width="50%">
</p>

Of course, in this kripke frame, there _are no 3-edges_! So no matter
which world is real, player 3 knows the real world and announces this.
So in any of these worlds, the game ends in 3 turns.

<br><br>

Notice, by doing this analysis, we are able to compute some interesting 
invariants of our game. For instance, the longest possible game lasts 3 turns,
and the "average" game (assuming each of the 7 possible real worlds occurs
with probability $\frac{1}{7}$) lasts $\frac{17}{7} \approx 2.42$ turns.

We can also answer some other interesting questions about the game. For instance:

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
Is it always the case that, after the game is over, everybody knows their 
hat color?
</div>

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
What is the maximum game length with 4 players? What is the expected game length?
What about for $n$ players?
</div>

You should really try this exercise yourself, and this 
might include programming a simulation of the game in order 
to get data for conjectures[^5]. 
In case you want to skip the programming and get straight to
the data gathering, I've uploaded my old sage file in a sister
blog post [here][11]. It's been a bit since we've had some 
good inline sage code for experimentation!

Ok. Now we've worked out the toy example, let's get back to business[^6].
Clue.

    I have no idea what these gifs are from, unfortunately. I found them
    on giphy ([red][6] and [blue][7]) by searching "blue hat" and looking 
    for a collection that had both blue and red hats...

    I thought it was from a music video at first 
    (and if it is, it's one I'd love to see), but it seems like it's 
    owned by a modeling company "Lindsey L33". 

    Either way, they're fun for the post, haha.

    Like clue ðŸ¤”

[^4]:
    Really each vertex should have a self loop of each label, since every
    player thinks a world is indistinguishable from itself. 

    This comes up in more complex analyses, but we're going to ignore it
    here because they clutter the graph.
