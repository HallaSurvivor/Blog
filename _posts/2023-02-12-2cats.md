title: Why Care about 2-Categories?
tags:

Give a little introduction, mention there's a lot of posts up in the air
right now, but I'm also busy learning about symplectic geometry 
(with an eye towards fukaya categories) for a 
research problem and it's taking a lot of my time.

First, give an example of the (2-)category of categories, 
finite product categories, topoi, etc.

Then, give the definition of a 2-category. 
Exercise: What is a 2-category with one object?

This is neat, and there's lots of natural examples, but
why should we _care_? 

We know there's some kind of duality between syntax and semantics
(link blog post), but how can we make that precise in special cases?

Consider (possibly multisorted) lawvere theories. The _syntax_
is a finite product category $\mathbb{T}$ and the _semantics_ are 
its various models, given as finite-product functors $\mathbb{T} \to \mathsf{Set}$.
(Mention you can take values in _any_ category, but for now we'll focus on $\mathsf{Set}$).

It's "well known" that there's a duality here. It turns out that
$\mathbb{T} \simeq \mathsf{Mod}_{fg}(\mathbb{T})^\text{op}$! 

This looks functorial, though, doesn't it? We have a "functor"
$\mathsf{Mod}(-)$ which eats a finite product category and outputs 
its category of models. In fact, $\mathsf{Mod}(-) \cong [-,\mathsf{Set}]$
should be "representable"!

Look at the stuff in Ademek, et. al to finish this.

---

In general, whenever we have a "category valued" functor, we probably want 
to work with some 2-categorical interpretation. 

After all, one of the original motivations for category theory was the 
ability to express things that are inverses, but only up to isomorphism.

Give the example of category of natural numbers with matrices, and vector spaces.
To build the functor from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathsf{Vect}$ we need to _choose_
a vector space of each dimension, but there's LOTS of choices! They key is
that they're all isomorphic. So even though $fgV \neq V$, we always have 
$fgV \cong V$. Moreover, these isomorphisms "cohere" in a way that makes them
compatible with all the linear maps! So even though we don't get equality 
on-the-nose, we get something that's basically just as good.

This is why the "right" notion of sameness for categories is _equivalence_,
not _isomorphism_ (which would require $fgV = V$)[^1].

BUt now let's look at the functor between theories and models. To get an 
equivalence of categories, we would need to show that 
$\mathsf{Th} \mathsf{Mod} \mathbb{T} \cong \mathbb{T}$.

Of course, this is false in general! We're merely guranteed that 
these two categories are _equivalent_, that is
$\mathsf{Th} \mathsf{Mod} \mathbb{T} \simeq \mathbb{T}$!

Again, though, these equivalences "cohere" in a way that makes them 
consistent with functors between the theories -- up to natural isomorphism.

Just as we required categories in order to organize the data of the 
"sameness up to isomorphism" phenomenon of sets, we require 2-categories to
organize the data of "sameness up to equivalence", or more poetically,
"sameness up to (sameness up to isomorphism)", for categories[^2]!

Give the example of sheaves in algebraic geometry. 
A single sheaf is a functor from open sets to $\mathsf{Ab}$ (say)
which satisfies a gluing condition (write this down).

But we can soup this up, and say that the _category_ of sheaves is a functor
from open sets to $\mathfrak{Cat}$ which satisfies a gluing condition
(write this down. cf. Vakil 2.5.D and 2.5.5).

Say something about (strict) 2-limits?

Sign off.

[^1]:
    Of course, sometimes isomorphism of categories _is_ what we want! 
    For instance, when we're viewing our category as an algebraic structure.

    I'm currently writing a blog post about the various lenses through which
    we can view categories, and I'll talk a bit more about this in that post.

[^2]:
    Say something about sets being "0-categories".
