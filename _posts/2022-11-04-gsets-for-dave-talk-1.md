title: Talk -- Working Inside the Topos of $G$-Sets
tags:
  - my-talks
---

This week I gave two talks on two days notice:
one on Tuesday, on the orbit-cone correspondence 
for [toric varieties][1] 
(this one was my fault -- I forgot I was speaking),
and one on Thursday, on externalizing statements 
from the topos of $G$-sets
(I've been trying to give this talk in this seminar 
for a while, and ironicaly I ran into the organizer
Dave Weisbart on Tuesday while ordering a tea before 
my other talk, and he invited me). 

Dave is interested in $G$-equivariant brownian motion, 
and I was telling him over lunch a while ago that I think
topos theory might be a good angle for attacking that problem.
After all, in the topos of $G$-sets, everything is automatically
$G$-invariant. Since this topos is boolean and satisfies 
the internal axiom of choice, we can just _do_ brownian motion
in this topos with no worries at all, then externalize to 
get statements about $G$-equivariant brownian motion.

Now, I haven't actually _tried_ doing any of this yet, so it's
possible that the statements we get aren't interesting, but the 
allure of actually doing something useful with topoi 
(and feeling like the last 5 years of my life have been worthwhile 
after all) is something I at least want to explore. My talk on Tuesday
was basically a sales pitch, to explain why doing math in a topos
(in particular in a boolean topos with choice) is easy, and how 
working in _this partiular topos_ might help solve his problem.

In the process of writing the talk (quite late at night...) I worked out 
some concrete examples that I want to share, even though I didn't get to
go over them in the talk itself[^1]. This overview is going to be more a 
description of the talk-to-be, rather than the talk as-it-was, mainly 
because I forget exactly what questions were asked. The astute among you
have probably also noticed the "part-1" in the url. That's because I was
invited to give a follow-up talk _next_ Thursday, where I'll go into 
slightly more depth on externalization, and probably compute some examples
_with_ the crowd so that we can all get a hang of the process[^2]. 

Anyways, that's mainly to say that this is going to be a much more relaxed
version of my usual talk recaps, and it'll feel more like a usual post 
where I ramble about some examples and reasons to care about a topic.

- informal idea for "new semantics for old syntax"
    
- explain topos of $G$-sets and topos of sheaves
- talk about externalizing (copy the algorithm from Maclane & Moerdijk)

[^1]:
    Dave asked a _lot_ of questions, and kind of derailed the entire talk,
    though apparently this is par for the course in his seminars, haha. 

    I didn't mind so much, since it meant he was really invested in the 
    material, and thankfully he didn't ask anything I couldn't answer. 
    I did feel a bit bad for other people in the seminar, who may not 
    have wanted the digressions (my talk would have been a lot easier to
    follow without them), but if this happens to most speakers, I assume
    they're used to it by now.

[^2]:
    I'll also write a lot less, haha. I think if I write it like an hour
    long talk instead of a 90 minute talk, I'll have a shot at actually 
    getting through it all.
