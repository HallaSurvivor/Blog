1. Quick overview of SnS. 

reference the trans math day talk?


"just by looking at a description tells you something about the object itself"

"things which admit nice descriptions tend to be nice", mention DST



These are the examples I could come up with off the top of my head. Leave others
in the comments!

2. $=, \leq, \geq$ are closed, $\neq, \lt, \gt$ are open
  - examples
  - proof

3. Borel Sets, $\mathbb{N}$ quantifiers, etc
  - example: the exercise from your post on LO groups

4. Analytic/Coanalytic sets are universally measurable
  - examples
  - true in any polish space?

5. word problem regular iff finite / context free iff virtually free
  - examples?

6. not an _exact_ fit, but polynomial growth iff virtually nilpotent

7. definable functions f : R^n --> R decompose their domain into finitely many
regions where f is cts (C^m?) on each region ( see marker, iirc )

8. something about hardy fields? check that book

9. groups w/ solvable word problem are exactly those which embed into each EC group?

10. definable graphs admit nice extremal bounds (cf. [here][1])

11. a bit of a stretch, but matrices are "syntax" for the "semantics" of a linear transformation
  - you can read off information about the transformation (eigenvalues, etc) from a matrix

12. monomial ideals

13. other stuff in combinatorial commutative algebra?

14. one relator groups


life pro tip: anytime you have some kind of "presentation" of your object,
ask what happens when you restrict attention to certain "nice" presentations

15. galois connection between modal logic frames and axioms

16. informally, every function you can write down is measurable

17. arithmatically, things with bounded quantifiers must be decidable predicates
