title: The Lebesgue Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

So I had an analysis exam last week which roughly covered the material in
chapter 3 of Folland's "Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications".
I'm decently comfortable with the material, but a lot of it has always felt 
kind of unmotivated. For example, why is the [Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem][1]
called that? It obviously looks _something_ like a derivative... But I was 
never able to quite make the connection feel solid. 

A big part of my studying process is fitting together the various theorems
into a coherent narrative. It doesn't have to be linear 
(in fact, it typically isn't!), but it should feel like the theorems share
some purpose, and fit together neatly. 
I also struggle to care about theorems before I know what they do. This is
part of why I care so much about examples, and it means the other half of
finding a narrative is understanding what kinds of problems our techniques
are good for. 

After a fair amount of reading and thinking[^1], I finally fit the puzzle 
pieces together. Since I wrote it all down for myself as part of my studying, 
I figured I would post it here as well in case other people find it useful. 

So then, let's get started!

To start, we need to remember how to relate functions and measures. Everything
we say here will be in $\mathbb{R}^1$.

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
  If $F$ is increasing and continuous from the right, then there is a 
  (unique!) regular borel maeasure $\mu_F$ so that 

  $$
  \mu_F((a,b]) = F(b) - F(a)
  $$

  Moreover, given any regular borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$, the function

  $$
  F_\mu \triangleq 
  \begin{cases}
     \mu((0,x]) & x > 0 \\
    0           & x = 0 \\
    -\mu((x,0]) & x < 0
  \end{cases}
  $$

  is increasing and right continuous.
</div>

This is more or less the content of the [Carath√©odory Extension Theorem][5].
It's worth taking a second to think where we use the assumptions on $F$. 
The fact that $F$ is increasing means our measure is positive. Continuity
from the right is a bit more subtle, though. Since $F_\mu$ is always right
continuous, we need to assume our starting function is right continuous
in order to guarantee $F_{\mu_F} = F$.

This is not a big deal, though. A monotone function is automatically continuous
except at a countable set (see [here][6], say) and at its countably many
discontinuities, we can force right-continuity by defining 

$$
F_r(x_0) \triangleq \lim_{x \to x_0^+} F(x)
$$

which agrees with $F$ wherever $F$ is continuous.
If we put our probabilist hat on, we say that $F_\mu$ is the 
<span class="defn">Cumulative Distribution Function</span> of $\mu$. 
Here $F_\mu(x)$ represents the total cumulative mass we've seen so far.

There's a very important question which we have to ask ourselves now.

    I was mainly reading Folland (Ch. 3), since it's the book for the course. 
    I've also been spending time with Terry Tao's lecture notes on the subject
    (see [here][4], and [here][2]), as well as 
    [this][3] PDF from Eugenia Malinnikova's measure theory course
    at Stanford. I read parts of Axler's new book, and while I meant to read
    some of Royden too, I didn't get around to it.
