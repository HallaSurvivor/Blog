title: Showing There is No Element of Some Order in a Group $G$

I took a practice algebra qual the other day, and was totally stumped by a 
pretty basic group theory question:

<div class=boxed markdown=1>
  Assume that $G$ is a simple group of order $168$. 

  (a) How many elements of order $7$ are there in $G$?
  (b) Show that $G$ does not contain any elements of order $14$.
</div>

Part (a) is a pretty routine application of the Sylow theorems.
