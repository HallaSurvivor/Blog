# Welcome!

I'm Chris Grossack, a queer mathematician and musician. My research interests 
lie in the intersection of algebra, geometry, and logic. An intersection 
often made clearer with the language of category theory.

Concretely, my two current active research areas are in Topological 
Field Theories (particularly their relationship to Low Dimensional Topology and 
Quantum Algebra) and in Topos Theory (particularly in its application to 
various notions of _synthetic mathematics_ such as Homotopy Type Theory).

You might be interested in [my CV](/cv) or [my blog](/blog). You can read 
more about me [here](/about).
